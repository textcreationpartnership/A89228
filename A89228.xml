         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Being induced thereto, chiefely, to teſtifie my humble reſpects unto your Highneſſe, to whom I have ever vowed my beſt endeavours of ſervice: next, to expreſſe my love, and thankfulneſſe to my country, and to my deere Camerades, <hi>Britaines, Dutch</hi> and <hi>Swedens,</hi> (companions, not of wants, but of valour) eternizing their memory, who after death, like <hi>Phœbean</hi> Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ride triumphing in ſpite of envy, being praiſed by their enemies, for having valorouſly reſiſted their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, till they died ſtanding, ſerving the publique, through their great love to your Highneſſe Royall Mother, the Queene of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> your Highneſſe ſelfe, and the remnant of the Royall Iſſue.

               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Oble, worthy, courteous, and loving <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> if J could perſwade thee to beleeve what profit the diligent and ſerious Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier doth reape by reading, and what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage he gaineth above him, who think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to become a perfect Souldier by a few yeares practiſe, without reading: Truely, thou wouldeſt uſe thy earneſt diligence as well in the one as in the other; for J dare be bold to affirme, that reading and diſcourſe doth as much or rather more, to the furtherance of a perfect Souldier, than a few yeares practiſe without reading.</p>
            <p>For out of my owne experience, in my profeſsion, having ſeene as many rare occurrences, and accidents of warre by practiſe (as hath not been ſeene the like in many yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) which ſhall appeare evidently by the ſubſequent Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of one Regiments ſervice: Nevertheleſſe, J muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that reading and diſcourſe of warres, inable the minde more with perfect knowledge, than the bare practiſe of a few yeares. Therefore, what theſe yeares paſt J have collected, by the one and the other, following the laudable profeſsion of Armes, under the mightie and potent King of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> the ſpace of three yeares, and ſince under his Majeſtie of worthy memory the Invincible King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> his Crowne,
<pb facs="tcp:132555:6"/>and Confederats, in foure yeares; gathered together for the good, profit, and furtherance of thee and my Country: whereby I hope the noble and worthy minded <hi>Reader,</hi> ſhall be allured and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated to follow the Traces of thoſe worthy <hi>Cavaliers</hi> mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in my Obſervations, of moſt worthy memories: Whereof ſome, from meane condition, have riſen to ſupreme honour, wealth, and dignitie; though others periſhed in the way of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for whoſe ſakes, my Sword ſhall be ever ready againſt the common Enemy, that ruined the old and worthy Regiment; the memory whereof ſhall never be forgotten, but ſhall live in ſpite of time; and its vertues and fame be made knowne to all thoſe intereſſed in the quarrell. The example of thoſe brave ſpirits (noble and worthy <hi>Reader</hi>) I hope, will allure you to follow their vertues, that you may be partaker of their honour, for the further credit of our Nation. Therefore, worthy <hi>Reader,</hi> what you find here, if you pleaſe, like; but howſoever, remember alwayes to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſparingly the writings of the ſhallow-brained <hi>Souldier,</hi> not adorned with eloquent phraſe; but with truth and ſimplicitie. <hi>Plinius</hi> ſaith, there was no book ſo little worth, but might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable in ſome things. <hi>Cæſar</hi> from his youth had his Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and the <hi>Bee</hi> out of the moſt poyſonable herbs ſuckes the honey. Pleaſe to reade, and thou ſhalt finde ſomething to delight thee; at leaſt thou ſhalt ſee my thankfulneſſe to my <hi>Camerades</hi> and <hi>Country,</hi> and examples of frequent mortality, to make thy uſe of. And as the ſtarres take light from the Sunne; even ſo from <hi>Hiſtories,</hi> men draw knowledge and wiſdome. Let me intreate thee therefore, when thou wouldeſt avoide care, to looke on thoſe obſervations, and by our examples amend thy life, and I ſhall be glad of thy profit, and not envy thy eſtate. If you ask; why I wrote theſe Obſervations? It was becauſe I loved my <hi>Camerades.</hi> If why I publiſhed them, know it was for my friends, and not for the world, for which I care not, nor for any that is ungrate; but thoſe which accept well of this, will encourage me betime, to take grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter paines for their ſakes, if they view them. <hi>Farewell.</hi>

Immediatly after our landing at <hi>Loughstad</hi> on the <hi>Elve,</hi> by command of his Majeſtie of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> we were quartered in the fat and fertile ſoyle of <hi>Holſten,</hi> nothing inferiour in fertilitie to any part of <hi>Dutchland,</hi> except in Wines, having Corne in abundance, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe <hi>Communibus Annis</hi> of the twentie eight Corne, Wheat and Barly: in milke, nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to <hi>Holland,</hi> and for the moſt part inhabited by <hi>Hollanders,</hi> eſpecially the Cities. This Soyle hath alſo abundance of freſh and ſalt-water fiſhes; their Gentry live like Noble men; and their Communaltie live like Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. During our enquartring with them, our entertainment was anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to our charges, where ſome Officers had allowance of a peece a day for keeping good Order. Lievtenant Colonell <hi>Arthur Forbeſſe</hi> had the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over the Regiment in the abſence of the <hi>Colonell,</hi> being hindred by ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Shortly after our going over, the Lievtenant Colonell departed this life, being a Gentleman of much true worth, and a valourous Commander, much regrated by the whole Regiment. Immediatly after his death, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Sanders Seaton</hi> was by his Majeſties Patent made Lievtenant Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell to the Regiment, who did bring a ſtrong Company of well exerciſed Souldiers, which were joyned to ſtrengthen the Regiment.

Who then would diſdaine to follow warres, might be thought unwiſe. The Baron of <hi>Fowles</hi> comming over a voluntier, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed a free Table to entertaine an Earle, being ordinarily above ſixteene perſons at Table; his Viſitors, horſes and ſervants entertained accordingly.</p>

               <p>The Regiment muſtered received colours, wherein his Majeſtie would have the Officers to carry the <hi>Danes</hi> croſſe, which the Officers refuſing they were ſummoned to compeare before his Majeſtie at <hi>Raynesberge,</hi> to know the reaſons of their refuſalls; at the meeting none would adventure, fearing his Majeſties indignation, to gaineſtand openly his Majeſties will, being then his Majeſties ſworne Servants: and for the eſchewing of greater inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the Officers deſired ſo much time of his maieſtie, as to ſend Captaine <hi>Robert Ennis</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> to knowe his Majeſtie of <hi>Great Britaines</hi> will, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no, they might carrie without reproach the <hi>Danes</hi> Croſſe, in <hi>Scottiſh</hi> colours: anſwere was returned; they ſhould obey their will, under whoſe pay they were, in a matter ſo indifferent.</p>
               <p>During the tedious winter, the Regiment was well exerciſed, and put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der good diſcipline, as well the particular companies, as the whole Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo that mine eyes did never ſee a more complete Regiment, for bodies of men, and valiant ſouldiers; as ſhall be ſeene in the diſcharge of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, begun with the ſheding of <hi>Duch-bloud.</hi>

               <p>THE land of <hi>Holſten</hi> full of proſperitie at this time, having all things in a golden ſwimme, and waving careleſly in a ſwallowing plentie, having her heart full of pleaſures, diſdaining what was to come, ruine ſeazed vpon this land within ſix months, after our riſing from quarters, to our firſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, towards the <hi>Waſer</hi> ſtreame. At our comming into the land, the prou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſort of them, diſdained ſouldiers, ſaying, they had no neede of ſtrangers, they were ſufficiently able themſelves to hold out the Emperors forces, their paſſes were ſtrong, their power in Armes were mightie of Horſe and foote, as any <hi>Province</hi> in <hi>Germanie;</hi> notwithſtanding whereof, in a ſhort time, they felt the wrath of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and were ruinated in the middeſt of their fortunes. I wiſh my Country, by a timely prevention to avoide the like, by ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſmooth ſtreame, being ordinarily deepeſt; leſt they ſhould become ſubject unto their enemies, their land waſted with fire, and ſword, their buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, and plantings deſtroyed, their riches, and Iewels made ſpoyle of, their wives abuſed, and their daughters deflowred, themſelves baniſhed, and their Religion perſecuted; in ſo much that their <hi>Paſtors</hi> flying to the <hi>Altar</hi> for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, were cruelly put to death. Since therefore their enemies are our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, we ought to beware.</p>
               <p>We ought alſo not to deny our betters in things indifferent, leſt the askers love waxe drie, and his revenge grow great: for to a generous ſpirit, as it is

Our Officers refuſing to carrie the the <hi>Danes Croſſe</hi> in their colours, diſobliged his Majeſtie ſo farre, by their denialls of a thing indifferent, that after the death of our worthy Lievtenant Colonell <hi>Arthur Forbeſſe,</hi> Lievetennant-Colonell <hi>Seaton</hi> was preferred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Officers wills, who once placed, would refuſe nothing unto his Majeſtie he would command.</p>

But time that alters all things, having favoured them, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to their companies againe.</p>
               <p>When we have good dayes we ſlight them, when they are gone, we ſinke under the wring of ſorrow, for their loſſe; and want teacheth vs the worth of things more truely: and it is a true ſaying, <hi>Bleſſings appeare not, till they bee vaniſhed.</hi> Our Officers that were diſcontented under the King of <hi>Denmarke</hi> without reaſon, having had both good quarters, and money, there after in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſervices would have been contented with leſſe.

               <p>Certainly, a good reſolution is the moſt fortifying Armour a diſcreet man can weare; that can defend him againſt all the unwelcome frownes, that the poore world puts vpon him: with this, we can be ſervants as well as Lords, and have the ſame inward pleaſantneſſe in the checkes of fortune, that we car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in her ſofteſt ſmiles; It was <hi>Zantippe's</hi> obſervation, that ſhe ever found <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> returne with the ſame countenance, that he went abroad withall. I wiſh no man ſo ſpiritleſſe, as to let all abuſes preſſe the dulneſſe of a willing ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: for reſolution is alwayes neceſſary in the waine of fortune, to ſave vs from diſcontentments, that uſually deject us. A wiſe man makes the trouble leſſe by fortitude, when a foole ſtoupes to it. The world hath nothing ſo glorious as vertue, which is like the paſſage of <hi>Haniball</hi> over the <hi>Alpes,</hi> a worke of trying toyle, of infinite danger, but once performed, it lets him in unto the worlds <hi>Garden, Italy</hi> leaving him a laſting fame.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> This magnanimous King his liberalitie we could not complaine of, having payd us in money, and with aſſignation of moneys, on our owne King; and good Quarters we had, which were not reckoned unto us; our true fidelitie his Majeſtie did oft-times commend, and our ſervice both. Therefore in my opinion, that bloud is not to be accounted loſt, which is ſhed for a Noble Maſter. Diligent, and diſcreet ſervants, are the beſt friends a noble King, or Prince can be bleſt withall: And as our deſerving in this ſervice was good, our reſpect was more than anſwerable; having beene many times feaſted, and Royally entertained, at his Majeſties Table; being of ſervants, made companions to the King our Maſter. Let no man then thinke it bondage, to ſerve a noble Maſter, and a bountifull King, as this was; yet he that lackes this ambition, to be made companion to earthly Kings, following this worldly warfare, I would admoniſh him, to be thankfull to the King of Kings, for his peace, and quietneſſe at home, and in his proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, to make his acquaintance with God, that if adverſitie come, he may be the bolder with his Maker, by prayer, which is the key to open heaven, and the meanes to remove our adverſitie: for to reach unto God, wee muſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our ſelves by prayer, uniting us unto him, through the greatneſſe of our love; for if we love God, we will be painfull to ſeeke him, and to find him, we muſt enter in the narrow way; and if wee will be partakers of his meate, we muſt firſt taſte of his continencie; if we will follow him to the breaking of his Bread, like valiant Souldiers, wee muſt not faint, till wee drinke of his Cup; and to gaine him, wee muſt learne to loſe our ſelves, for his ſake.

The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this march was the enemies Army drawing ſtrong to a head in <hi>Luniburgh</hi> land, of intention to force a paſſage over the <hi>Elve</hi> to come the eaſier to <hi>Holſten:</hi> his Majeſtie being weake of foote in this quarter, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no great feare of his enemie on the <hi>Waſer,</hi> where we lay before; we were therefore called to joyne with the reſt of our Regiment at <hi>Byſenburgh.</hi> Another reaſon of this march was, the Kings forces in <hi>Sileſia</hi> being alſo weake of Foote, ſtanding in great neede of a timely ſupply, we being able to endure a long march, his Majeſty reſolved, after beſetting well the paſſe on the <hi>Elve,</hi> to ſend us for a ſupplie unto the <hi>Sileſian</hi> Armie: Nevertheleſſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times we ſee in warres, though things be long adviſed on, and proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after adviſe duely, yet the event doth not alwayes anſwer to mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures: For it is a true old ſaying; Man propoſeth, but God diſpoſeth.</p>
               <p>A Commander having the charge of a Regiment,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> or partie, on a march, ought in all reſpects to be as carefull and diligent as a Generall, that leads an Army, being ſubject to the like inconvenience of fortune. Wherefore he ought to be well provided of all things fitting for his march, that, in time of Rancounter with the enemy, he might the better diſcharge his duty, eſpecially being provided with good ſtore of Ammunition, both for the mouth and ſervice, with ſufficient fix Armes.</p>
               <p>He ought alſo, for his march ever to have good intelligence, leſt his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie ſhould circumvent him. He ought alſo to order his march, according to the countries ſcituation he marches thorough, appointing his Randez-vouz nightly, ſhort, or long, as his Quarters may fall in beſt ſecurity.</p>
               <p>He ought alſo to keepe his Officers and Souldiers in continuall good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of diſcipline, without ſuffering the one, or the other to fall off from their Stations, without great and urgent occaſions; and if any of them chance to fall off, he is obliged to foreſee to their timely returnes.</p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:132555:14"/>
               <p>Likewiſe he ought not in any manner of way ſuffer violence to be uſed to <hi>Boores,</hi> or ſtrangers in his march, and if ſuch doth happen, he is obliged to do juſtice to all, and to ſee examplarie puniſhment done, to terrifie others from the like. He ought alſo, to be carefull to give none under his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand juſt occaſion of complaint, for want of their dues, either in quarters, or in diſtributing of their victualls, according to their ſtrengths. He ought alſo on his march to be provident, in cauſing to bring their Proviant timely to their Randevouz, or Hawlts; ſeeing it to be rightly diſtributed, for avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of contentions happening moſt commonly at ſuch times.</p>
               <p>Alſo he muſt foreſee before he makes a hawlt, that the ground be conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient where he drawes up, whether he be in feare of an enemie, or not; and at ſuch times, he muſt be carefull, that centries be duly placed, at all parts needefull, and that no man be ſuffered to wander, or go aſtray, from the haulting part, for feare he be to ſeeke, when occaſion ſhould preſent either to breake up, to march, or otherwiſe, in caſe of Alarum, to have his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, or ſouldiers wandering, while as the enemie ſhould charge, were a groſſe error.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe, he ought to be of ſtrict command, and authority to puniſh thoſe that on a march leave their Armes behind them, or that are careleſſe in keeping their Armes both fix, and cleane. In quartering either in village, field or Citie, he muſt give orders for his poſts to keepe Guards upon, and he ought himſelfe to recognize all avenues, and inquire of the knowne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimen, the paſſes, whereby his enemies may come unto him, and of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance he is from his enemy; he muſt alſo direct parties on all quarters of Horſemen to get intelligence, and Conſchaift of his enemie, leſt unawares he ſhould be ſurpriſed.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe at his upbreaking from quarters, he ſhould take notice of all complaints, and do juſtice accordingly: And he ſhould have a ſpeciall care of the ſicke, either to tranſport them, or to foreſee for their good uſage, in caſe neceſſitie, or weakeneſſe force him to leave them behind. He ought alſo, to foreſee before he march for his Guides and to give charge to keepe them from running away; and he ought to learne of the guide the inconveniences on the way that may be hinderſome unto his march, that timely he might provide a remedie. His Guide ſhould alſo know how far to go, that when he comes his length, he may timely provide for another. He ought alſo to learne the beſt way for his Baggage, and Ammunition to march on, and in caſe of ſuſpected danger, he ought to ordaine a guard of Musketiers with a ſufficient Officer to command for their convoy, and if it be ſuch way, as that on occaſion his Ammunition cannot be ſteadable unto him, in ſuch a caſe he muſt not part from his Ammunition waggons; but rather to keepe one way, though it ſhould be far about.</p>
               <p>He ought never for paſtime, or pleaſure, on a ſuſpected march neere an enemy, to go from the ſight of his Troopes; for feare he ſhould be abſent in greateſt neede, or that ſome misfortune might happen betweene thoſe he commands himſelfe, or againſt others incurring in their wayes. If occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſervice offer, he muſt never be dejected, but to encourage ever his owne moſt in the greateſt extreamity, ſhewing teſtimonies of his inward valour and ſetledneſſe of minde, by his by-paſt experience, teſtifying he is no Novice, not taking counſell of others, when he is with reſolution to rancounter a brave enemy.</p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:132555:15"/>
               <p>He muſt be of judgment to conſider on the ſudden his enemies deſigne, and timely he ought to oppoſe his enemy, either with few, or with many, as he finds his beſt advantage, And if his enemy be too far ſtronger than he, he muſt timely reſolve how to make a ſafe retreat, being forced thereto; Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving his ſouldiers, to a fitter opportunitie: for once far ingaged, the retreat will be the more difficult to make without great loſſe; He ought alwayes to keepe a good reſerve of freſh, brave, reſolute fellowes to keepe faces on their enemies, while as others ſhould be forced to turne backe on them: at ſuch times, and in ſuch occaſions the reſolution, the courage, and the judgment of a valourous Commander is beſt knowne; for many can advance raſhly, that have never the wit, or judgment to retire bravely, as is ordinarily ſeene in many ſuch Commanders, more ſtout, than wiſe. But leſt I ſhould enter too far to this purpoſe in this obſervation, for feare to be blamed my ſelfe for not retiring in time, it being a large field I entred in, let this ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for this march of the Leaders duty.

               <p>Now to retire, being quartered a mile from <hi>Lovenburgh</hi> in a Dorpe, where the Boore for feare quit his lodging, ſo that for want of proviſion we were forced to ſend our Suttler called <hi>Iohn Matheſon,</hi> towards <hi>Loven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh:</hi> in his abſence our Boyes made uſe of his rugge to cover their faces; in drowning of Bee-hives, the rugge being rough did lodge a number of the Bees, which, when the Boyes had drowned the Bee hives, they threw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: The Suttler comming late home we being a bed, went to reſt; and putting off his cloathes, drew his rugge to cover him, but as ſoone as the Bees found the warmeneſſe of his skinne, they began to puniſh him for his long ſtay, That he was forced roaring like a mad man, to riſe, and throw off his rugge, not knowing (though well he felt) the ſmart of his ſudden enemies; we called to him, asking, if he was mad: he made no anſwer, but ſtill cried the Divell had bewitch'd him, in piercing him in a thouſand parts, ſtill rubbing and ſcratching, crying with paine, not knowing the reaſon, till a candle was lighted, and ſeeing the Bees, threw his rugge in a draw-well; The gentle reader may judge whether, or not, he was puniſhed, for his long ſtay.

               </head>
               <p>HAving reſted here three dayes on the fields, till our Colonell came from <hi>Hamburgh</hi> with a monethes meanes to the Regiment, our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies paid, we got orders for a new march towards <hi>Rapine</hi> in the Marke, where the old Markegrave <hi>fon Turlaugh</hi> lay at <hi>Haggelberge</hi> with a part of his Majeſties Army, and the enemie lay againſt him on the other ſide of the <hi>Haggell,</hi> our orders were to divide our Regiment againe, and to leave Major <hi>Dumbarre</hi> with foure companies to beſet <hi>Beyſenburgh</hi> Skonce, the enemies army being then within five miles of it, ten thouſand ſtrong of foote beſides Horſe. The other ſeaven companies were ordained to march with the Colonell and Lievetenant colonell towards <hi>Rapine,</hi> as ſaid, is; we ſevered not without teares, both of Officers and ſouldiers. But he that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:132555:15"/>ſerves a maſter, muſt obey. The firſt night our Camerades accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us to our quarters. The next morning our march continuing, newes over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes us, the enemy is ſet downe before <hi>Beyſenburgh</hi> Skonce. In the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſervice I muſt be ſuccinct, being loath, having not ſeene the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, to ſet any thing in Record, but what I know to be truth, neither can I be particular in the declaration of this ſervice done by our countrimen, though it be generally well ſpoken of, over all Germany, yet I muſt ſay ſomewhat, and if my Report diminiſh from their credit, I proteſt it is not for lacke of love, but for want of information.</p>
               <p>The enemy hearing we were marched,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> and having gotten true intelligence how ſtrong they lay in the Skonce, he marched ten thouſand ſtrong, and lay downe within a cannon ſhot of the Skonce, and having begun his lines of approach, The firſt night, the Major made an out-fall, where having brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhowen their courage, and reſolution, returned againe without great loſſe.</p>
               <p>The enemy longing to be repared of this their bravade, reſolved to ſtorme the Skonce at all quarters, but finding reſolution joyned with valour againſt him, after long fighting in vaine, he is beate off from the walles, and forced to retire at that time, with the loſſe of five hundred men at leaſt. But having redoubled his forces the next time, ſets on with greater fury than before, but is beate off the ſecond time alſo, with loſſe; the third time he adventured, and, as was reported, the <hi>Scots</hi> defenders, as is well knowne, behaved themſelves ſo well, that the enemy ſtorming the walles, the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for want of powder threw ſand in their enemies eyes, knocking them downe with the Butts of muskets, having beene divers times Pell, mel through others; at laſt the enemy is forced to retire without effectuating any thing.</p>
               <p>Yet, gentle Reader, thinke that at ſuch play, the loſſe was not onely of one ſide, but of both, for in defence of this Skonce being ſo oft ſtormed; that ever praiſe-worthy Captaine <hi>Learmond,</hi> Brother to my Lord <hi>Balcomy,</hi> being twice ſhot with a musket, received deaths wound, and after died at <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> in perfect memory, diſcharging his duety Chriſtianly to God, as he did during his life time both to God and man.</p>
               <p>For his ſake, and in remembrance of his worth and valour, the whole Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Regiment did weare a black mourning Ribben: in this conflict alſo was killed his Lievtenant, called <hi>David Martin,</hi> an old, ſtout and expert Officer: many other valourous fellows, that were there, carried the true markes of their valour imprinted in their bodies, for their Countries credit. There was alſo, a <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Gentleman under the enemy, who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to ſcale the walls, ſaid aloud, Have with you Gentlemen, thinke not now you are on the ſtreets of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> bravading: One of his owne Country-men thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting him through the body with a Pike, he ended there. This Skonce ſo well maintained by our Country-men, is to their prayſe recorded at length in the <hi>Dutch Story</hi> of the <hi>Danes</hi> warres, where the curious Reader may learne more of it. The enemy finding this opportunitie to faile, at another paſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove this on the <hi>Elve</hi> watched by <hi>Dutch</hi> ſurpriſing the watch, did come o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Elve:</hi> the newes comming to his Majeſtie, he preſently ſends Orders in the night to <hi>Major Dumbarre,</hi> who commanded the Skonce to retire, and to bring off his Cannon, and to cut off the bridge, and then to come by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

Which diſcourſe I muſt now leave, and proſecute the continuance of our march towards <hi>Rapine.</hi>

               <p>After this ſervice the renowne ſpread ſo abroad, where ever we came, that the Gentrie of the Country were ready meeting us, providing all neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for us.

               <head>The fourth Obſervation.</head>
               <p>IN this obſervation, though the dutie be ſuddenly diſcharged, wee have much to amplifie the obſervation; firſt, by reaſon of the diſpute that did ariſe betwixt his Majeſtie and the <hi>Colonell,</hi> for offering to Caſhiere ſome of his Officers for alleaged inſufficiency, by the information of ſome malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Spirits amongſt our ſelves, whoſe names I will ſuppreſſe, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons alſo, letting ſome other tongue, not mine, divulge their ſhame. At this time alſo before our riſing to this expedition we were diſcontented of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion made of our Regiment, being abſolutely divided by his Majeſties au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, without the conſent of our <hi>Colonell,</hi> who would have been loath to have left Captaine <hi>Learmond</hi> behinde, that had done him ſo many notable good offices, and this noble Gentleman of famous memory, at his leave-ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his <hi>Colonell,</hi> my brother and me, being then his intireſt <hi>Camerades,</hi> with teares revealed unto us, whom he thought was the plotter of his ſtay, and withall did with griefe in a manner foretell his owne fall, alleaging we
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:132555:16"/>ſhould never meet againe. Therefore, for the love I bare to my deare <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merade,</hi> I will point at the heart of thoſe, who had a hand in the ſeparation of the Regiment. I muſt therefore crave pardon a little, to expreſſe my dutie for the loſſe of this noble, and vertuous <hi>Cavalier,</hi> whoſe heart and eyes were ever fixed upon vertue, and upon his love to his deare friends. He hates not, but with cauſe, that is unwilling to hate at all. And it is the end that ſhewes the difference betwixt vertue and vice. Fie then upon thoſe judgements, that, for their owne aymes, hatch the Ruine of their <hi>Camerades,</hi> in fore-thinking, and purſuing evill. And as the diſcharge of my laſt dutie was Tragicall, the reaſons of it I will ſet downe obſcurely, pointing at ſome, that every man may examine his own conſcience, that had any hand in plotting, or hatching, (by villanous policie, bred of envie,) the ruine of their <hi>Camerades,</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward whereof doth ſtill awaite them with ſhame in a killing ambuſh, <hi>when the Lord of Hoſts will bring to light the hidden plots of the malicious man.</hi> Here I could make ſome to bluſh, that I know plotted the fall of their <hi>Camerades.</hi> But I will be dumbe, doing by them, as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> thought to have done by <hi>Mary,</hi> in ſeeking to cover blemiſhes with ſecrecie, leſt I ſhould wound ſome ſo with my penne, as to make them by their <hi>Camerades,</hi> to be puſh't out of Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. But I will rather ſhew my charitie to the delinquent, by concealing of his fault, and tell him of it in ſecret, than openly to divulge his miſchiefe, ſeeing I wiſh his amendment before the world ſhould know his amiſſe: I will not therefore be too harſh, or virulent, hoping for his penitency, wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God may enlighten his conſcience, that while he hath time, he may crave pardon for his hatched evill. Being ſorry for the loſſe of theſe two worthy <hi>Cavaliers,</hi> of famous memory, <hi>Learmond</hi> and <hi>Dumbarre,</hi> for whoſe ſakes, with griefe I have pointed thus obſcurely at the forger of theſe <hi>Cavaliers</hi> fall, whoſe name I will ſuppreſſe, though my heart knows him well; and hoping time may change him to another man, I will let him be his own <hi>Beadle,</hi> and for his puniſhment, I would not care, though he were made to ſing an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vective</hi> againſt himſelfe. But I pray God, we may be freed of the like our ſelves, and not to looke upon another, with a <hi>Beam'd</hi> eye, but rather to be our owne <hi>Antidot's,</hi> againſt all the poyſon that another is able to ſpit upon us. Let us then have our eyes fixed upon vertue, and we ſhall finde a beautie, that will every day take us with ſome grace or other: For the world hath nothing ſo glorious in it as vertue, when ſhee rides <hi>Triumphing,</hi> as both theſe <hi>Cavaliers</hi> doe after death, in deſpight of their enemies, like <hi>Phoebean Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> prayſed by their enemies, for reſiſting their ſtrongeſt aſſaults, are now renowned in deſpight of envie, and the abuſive world.


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> And the worthy Souldiers, their <hi>Aſſociats</hi> in this memorable conflict, and hot ſtorme, are not to be forgotten, but to be prayſed for their valour. For though, as I ſaid, by appearance to looke but on their outſides, they were the meaneſt in ſhew of our whole Regiment: yet <hi>God that gives hearts, and courage unto men,</hi> made them the inſtruments of our Regiments firſt credit in the warres of <hi>Germany.</hi> They were, I confeſſe, led by brave Officers, which were ſeconded and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed by reſolute and ſtout Souldiers, that gained victory, and credit, over their enemies in extremitie, by caſting ſand in their eyes. This victory puts me in mind of a prettie Story, ſhewing that ſome times the meaneſt things, doe helpe us much againſt our enemies, eſpecially, when the LORD will bleſſe our fighting, with meane Inſtruments, fighting for us for his owne glory.</p>

We ſee then, that an immortall good name is attained unto by vertue, and not by villany.</p>
               <p>Here alſo in this conflict we ſee, notwithſtanding of the enemies eager pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit with fury, that reſolution at laſt prevailes; for the defenders having at firſt reſiſted their fury, the enemy with loſſe being forced to retire, the aſſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers were diſcouraged, and the defenders incouraged. Therefore it is the dutie of a brave Captaine, that is to be aſſailed, to reſiſt the beginnings well, and then the end muſt needs be glorious.</p>
               <p>In ſuch occaſions,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> happie is that Commander, that, in extremitie of danger, is accompanied with a few truſtie friends and Souldiers: He may be aſſured not to be forſaken, as I have beene ſome times by ſtrangers. The valiant Souldier is ever beſt knowne in the greateſt extremitie of danger, and a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beaten enemy, once or twice repulſed, will be loath to continue his purſute: But he that would gaine honour, muſt reſolve to contemne death, though ever before his eyes. Wherefore I would wiſh the brave Souldier to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver well prepared to die, who ſhould glory in nothing earthly more than in the tokens of his valour, being knowne they were got with credit, and not by infamie; as many unworthy Souldiers oft-times get wounds, but not with credit, while for their cowardiſe they are running away, y et they will vaunt amongſt the unknowne, as if their wounds were credibly gotten. Here alſo we may ſee the reſolution and courage of our Country-man to be prayſe-worthy, though killed ſerving the Emperour; for though I loved him not, being mine enemy, yet I honour his memory, in ſerving them truely, whom he did ſerve, for his owne credit.</p>
               <p>Of all profeſſions men of our profeſſion ought to looke neereſt to their credits, being attained unto by much toyle, and travell; and is loſt with little. Therefore it is ſaid, that a valourous man his credit hangs, as it were, at one haire, and one little errour or overſight in command, can obnubilate all his former glory. Circumſpect then had we need to be, to preſerve this credit, ſo dearely bought, and eaſily loſt.</p>
               <p>We muſt not then looke to the outſide of a man, but unto his vertues; for he that judgeth men of our profeſſion by <hi>Phyſiognomie,</hi> ſhall oft-times be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; for he that is not ſtout by nature in our profeſſion, having ſerved out a ſeaven yeares prentiſhip under ſuch a Leader, as the magnanimous King of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> ſuch a one, though not ſtout by nature, by frequencie of danger is made ſtout, as a ſword, fearing nothing, not death it ſelfe.

               <head>The fift Obſervation.</head>
               <p>HEre we have repreſented unto us, the mutability, of humane eſtates, and eſpecially of warres, the whe ele turning, we that looked to go forwards, were forced to retire, humane affaires being oppoſed as a marke to all the ſhots of diſcontentment; ſo that we ought not to rejoyce too much in a calme, or prove faint hearted in a ſtorme. We reade of a Roman Captaine, who did tremble being victorious, as being uncertaine how long his good fortune might continue. And the Romans (as <hi>Scipio</hi> tould the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Antiochus</hi>) were not puft up by victory, nor caſt downe by loſſe. And <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaid, this life of ours, was doubtfull, blind, miſerable, made of a floud of humors, ebbing, and flowing.</p>
               <p>Notwitſtanding whereof, it is the duety of a wiſe Commander to make uſe of the time, by diligent fore-ſight, and wiſe deliberation, to ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and others ſo long as he may, and not to be dejected, at every buffet unconſtant fortune doth give him.</p>
               <p>As this old Generall his reſolution at this time, having an enemy before him, was good, the enemy coming alſo behinde him, tooke his march be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt both, and did come fortunately to his wiſhed forecaſt, putting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and his Army in aſſurance. This old Generall was of good experience, but not fortunate, neither were they fortunate whom he ſerved, though of invincible courage, and of great underſtanding in warres: for, to give his Majeſty of <hi>Denmarke</hi> his due, no man breathing, I thinke, carries a ſtouter heart then he doth: Yet I have ſeene his Majeſtie far dejected in ſpirit, through great loſſe, and no wonder, as you ſhall heare more particularly ſet downe in the ſeventh obſervation.</p>
               <p>In this Retreat we were not voide of feare, but ſuſpecting the worſt, every man bethinking himſelfe of his beſt ſafety, to eſchew an appare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t overthrow, a thing at all times moſt dangerous in an Army. Our Horſemen, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of a retreat by water, and conſequently the loſſe of their Horſes, for want of ſhipping, and which was more, they feared the loſſe of their goods, and their owne impriſonment: but it was in vaine they ſhould torment themſelves before hand, for things without their powers to eſchew. But they ought rather to have made uſe of the preſent, and to have foreſeene the future ſo far as lay in them, reſolving patiently againſt all croſſes and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the event to God.</p>
               <p>Here alſo I did obſerve the inconvenience that comes to ſouldiers, through eating much fleſh without ſalt, or bread, which did bring diſeaſes in the Leager, ſo that many died of peſtilence and flux: but of our Nation feweſt, for to ſpeake truth, I never did ſee more durable men againſt all Toyle, travell and tediouſneſſe, than they were.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe I did obſerve firſt here,

<note place="margin">H. F. obſ.</note> in flattering the victorious, and in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting of the loſer, which is ever well ſeene in all eſtates.</p>
               <p>When we are happie in the ſpring-tide of abundance, and in the riſing floud of plenty, then the world would be our ſervants: but when theſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant waters fall to ebbing, then men looke upon us, at a diſtance. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore adverſity is like <hi>Penelopes</hi> night, which undoes all, that ever the day did weave. And our miſery is ſo, that we can never trie a friend, but in the kieke

               <p>HAving remained five weekes in this Leager, during which time, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration was making, for the tranſportation of the Army unto <hi>Holſten;</hi> ſeeing the Emperors forces come from <hi>Sileſia,</hi> and <hi>Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi> Army were joyned very ſtrong, which barr'd our paſſage from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into <hi>Holſten</hi> by land, which made us ſhip our Army for going unto <hi>Heligenhoven;</hi> and from thence to the paſſe of <hi>Oldenburgh</hi> in <hi>Holſten,</hi> of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to ly ſecured there, till the reſt of his Majeſties forces might joyne with us.

               </p>
               <p>Having all ſafely landed, at <hi>Heligenhoven:</hi> we marched towards the paſſe of <hi>Oldenburgh,</hi> where arrived before night, our Leager was drawne out into the moſt convenient part, for maintaining of the paſſe, where the firſt night we begin to worke in the Trenches, and continue working the whole night, and the next day, till noone, that the enemy was ſeene marching to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the paſſe, in full Battalions of Horſe, and foote, which before three of the clocke had planted Batteries, to play with Cannon on our Leager and to force a paſſage over the paſſe, which our Generall perceiving, gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to double the Guards both of Horſe, and foote; As alſo ſtrongly to <hi>Barricade</hi> the paſſe, and to caſt up in the night a redout before the paſſe: the night drawing on being darke, ſilence was over all, on both ſides of the paſſe.</p>
               <p>But the day cleering, the Guardes on both ſides begin the skirmiſh, the Cannons on both ſides begin to diſcharge, the Horſe Guards charge one another, till ours were forced to give ground; the foote Guards beginning to fight, the reliefes were commanded on both ſides to ſecond their owne, the ſervice growing hot; and the paſſe in danger of loſing.</p>
               <p>My Colonell in all haſte was commanded to march with the halfe of his Regiment to maintaine the paſſe; The Colonell commanded me,

The Generall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending their courage, and reſolution, doth bleſſe them in paſſing.

And we drawing neere to the paſſe, The <hi>Dutch,</hi> that were on ſervice being all fled but the Captaine, the paſſe neere loſt, my Colonell drawes off a plotton of Musketiers of the Right wing, being moſt of them brave young gentlemen of the Colonells owne companie, which in all haſte with an Officer were directed to maintaine the paſſe, which being hardly purſued, ſundry worthy young gentlemen did lie on the place in the defence of it, and ſundry were hurt, as <hi>Andrew Monro, Hector Monro, Alexander Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lough, Arthur Forbeſſe,</hi> and divers more, of common ſouldiers. By this time, the reſt of the Colonells diviſion were not idle from ſervice, the reliefes go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing often on, and the reſt doing ſervice along the paſſe, having a hedge for their ſhelter, The Body of the Pikes ſtanding, for two howers in battell, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mercy of Cannon and musket, ſo that their ſuffrings and hurts were greater both amongſt Officers and Souldiers, than the hurt done to the Musketiers, that were on ſervice, for few of their Officers eſcaped unhurt, as Enſigne <hi>Ennis,</hi> Enſigne <hi>Stewart,</hi> Enſigne <hi>Monro;</hi> divers alſo were killed, as <hi>Andrew Monro, Ferwhar Monro,</hi> and <hi>Murdo Powlſon</hi> was killed with a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Q"/> In time of this hot ſervice, powder being diſtributing amongſt ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, a whole Barrell was blowne up, whereby the Colonell was burnt in the face, and many Souldiers ſpoiled: the enemy ſeeing our powder blowne up, preſſe to force the paſſage, and ſome comming over, Captaine <hi>Iohn Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> with a few Musketiers was commanded in a flat Champange to encounter the enemy, who forced the enemy to retire, ſo that the paſſe was cleered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine by Captaine <hi>Iohn</hi> his valour, much to his credit.</p>

This ſervice conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in this manner from ſeaven a clocke in the morning, till it was paſt foure in the afternoone, firſt began, with the halfe of the Regiment, who were relieved by the other halfe, which continued till mid-day; after that the ſervice not being ſo hot, as before, they went on to ſervice by companies, one company relieveing another, till night that it grew darke, and then darkeneſſe, the enemy of valour, made the ſervice to ceaſe.</p>
               <p>During all this time, our Horſemen ſtoode bravely in Battell under mercy of Cannon, and Musket, beſides the foote, attending to ſecond us, in caſe the enemy had ſet over, and forced the paſſe, which once he adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to do, but was ſuddenly beaten backe: all this while, the Generall the Duke of <hi>Weimar,</hi> and both the Armies, were witneſſes to the manly and brave cariage of this praiſe-worthy Regiment.</p>
               <p>In the evening before night ammunition on both ſides growing ſcarce, &amp; darkeneſſe comming on, the ſervice begins to beare up: by this time, there
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:132555:19"/>is a Barrell of beere ſent us, from the Leager, the Officers for haſte cauſed to beate out the head of it, that every man might come unto it, with hat, or head-peece, they flocking about the waggon, whereon the Barrell lay, the enemies Cannonier gives a voley to their beere, which, by Gods providence, though ſhot amongſt the mid'ſt of them, did no more harme, but blew Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell and beere in the Ayre, the neereſt miſſe that I did ever ſee; for many of them were downe to the grounde, whereof my brother, Captaine <hi>Obſtell</hi> of worthy memory was one.</p>
               <p>At night the ſervice ceaſt, I was ſent by the reſt of the Officers to the Leager to my Colonell for Orders, to learne of the Generall, who ſhould relieve us at night: My Colonell did go to the Generalls Tent, and I with him, to have his Excellences reſolution, who haveing Nobly accepted of the Colonell, did praiſe him and his Regiment, requeſting him, that as the Regiment had done bravely all day, in being the inſtruments under God of his ſafety, and of the Armies, he would once more requeſt him, that his Regiment might hold out the inch, as they had done the ſpan, till it was darke, and then they ſhould be relieved, as he was a Chriſtian; And drinkeing to me, I returned with a Reſolution to my Camerades, leaving my Colonell in the Leager: And as it grew darke,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="R"/> we were relieved by the Duke of <hi>Weimar</hi> his earneſt and diligent intreaty, having proved our good friend, in urging to take us firſt off.

               <p>THe wiſe Ancients ſaid, it was the principall thing in all things to looke unto the end: but it is the propertie of our Nation to be over wiſe behinde the hand; as we were after the ſervice, having loſt thereat a great many of our friends, we ought to have beene the more cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect againe.

               <p>Amongſt the <hi>Romans</hi> none was admitted to the dignity of a Commander, till firſt he had paſt a prentiſhip under a brave Generall, where he was taught the uſe of Armes, and Novices durſt not be ſo bould, as to intrude themſelves in this honourable profeſſion, in any degree, to take command on them, without long practiſe, and experience, as was requiſite to undergo a charge in ſo high a calling, and of ſuch importance, as to leade others: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, the ground worke or foundation of Military diſcipline once well laid, then they were ſuffered to advance by degrees unto high charges, propoſing recompence, and reward unto thoſe, that did merite, and to that effect, they invented ſeverall ſorts of Crownes, for the reward of their travells, and wiſdome: Amongſt others, the Crowne called <hi>Obſidionall</hi> was ordained, for thoſe that entred firſt the beſieged places, being of the moſt eſteeme of all crownes, which was made of the Roote of the Herbes, or graine, that had taken Roote within the place beſieged; alſo thoſe that firſt ſcaled the walls, were wont to get a crowne of the Herbe Woodbinde, or <hi>Parietaria,</hi> Pelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory growing on the walls, and thoſe that firſt entred the enemies Ports by
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:132555:20"/>force, had alſo a crowne given unto them; And the crowne <hi>Caſtean</hi> was ordained, for him that firſt entred the enemies Trenches, and brake the <hi>Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſades,</hi> making way to enter unto the enemies Leager: Alſo a crowne was given unto thoſe of the <hi>Navall</hi> Armie, that firſt entred the Enemies Gallies, or ſhips on Sea, this Crowne was made of gold, repreſenting the Combat, and the Generall a foote, being victorious, had given him a crowne made of Hats, and Miters, and triumphing in a chariot, he carried a Hat made of Lawrell. At laſt, theſe crownes were made of Gold, laid over with preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtones. They had alſo given them, for recompence of their travels, Chaines, and Bracelets, all to the end they might accuſtome themſelves to vertue, and to the diſcipline and toyle of warres. Who then would not deſire to be of this ſociety, to get a crowne for well doing? On the contrary, Cowards, Poultrons, and Effeminate perſons, were diſdained, degraded and put off charge, while the valiant were honoured, advanced, and recompenced, as the Turke doth practiſe to this day; to the diſgrace of Chriſtians negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting diſcipline, till they are overthrowne. It ſhould then be the duety of brave Generalls to make choice of brave and vertuous Commanders, not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of whom they come, but where, and how long, have they practiſed to be vertuous. Then we ſee here, what was the cuſtome of the Ancient <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> in chooſing the vertuous, that had paſt their prentiſhip, and not Novi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to be Commanders: for we ſee, that the love of the Publique brings honour, pleaſure and profit to the vertuous, who thinke on it ſincerely; But thoſe, that would raiſe their fortunes by the ruine of others, ſhall never proſper.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of our coming to this paſſe of <hi>Owldenburgh</hi> was, to have ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there in ſafety from our enemies, till we might joyne with our friends; but the Enemy prevented us, in coming betwixt us and our friends: then there was no remedy, but to hold him up at the paſſe, till our Army might joyne with us, and of this intention we reſolved for beſt, to maintaine the paſſe, as we did, till Ammunition grew ſcant, and then we were forced to retire to our ſhips.</p>
               <p>This King is powerfull by Sea, and is mightily well furniſhed of all things neceſſary for warres, of Armes, Artillery, Ammunition, victualls, money, and what elſe is requiſit to ſet forwards a warre; and, which is more, a noble, and a liberall Maſter, as ever I did ſerve.</p>
               <p>Here alſo I obſerve the ſlowneſſe of our <hi>Generall,</hi> that did not patronize the paſſe ſome few dayes before the Enemies coming, that it might have beene fortified: for it was no time for us to fortifie the paſſe in the night, when the enemie came before us, and the next day, we were not ſuffered to worke, being otherwiſe imployed. Another overſight was, that our <hi>Generall</hi> did not know certainly, how we were provided of Ammunition, for though we had Lead in abundance, we wanted Bullets in the time of need. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the <hi>Generall</hi> was accuſed, after our comming into <hi>Denmarke,</hi> and the blame was found in the Commiſſary, that had the charge of the Artillery, <hi>Et jure,</hi> for they were all Rogues, and deceived his Majeſtie, that truſted them too much. Nevertheleſſe, I cannot excuſe the <hi>Generall</hi> of being ignorant of the proviſions ordained for the Armie; ſeeing he was certaine of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies comming: for it is moſt ſure, if we had been provided of Ball, we were ſufficiently baſtant to have kept the paſſe againſt our Enemy, ſince it came not in the Enemies power, till we had left it voluntarily in the night. The
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:132555:20"/>enemy alſo retiring from us, hearing the <hi>Rhinegraves</hi> forces were coming behinde him, of intention to joyne with us. I obſerved alſo, that the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi> was too ſlow, in the encouragement of his Officers and Souldiers, having delayed his exhortation to the very time of our going on ſervice. And it is eaſie, at ſuch time, to <hi>Prognoſticate</hi> by the countenance going on ſervice, how they are affected. But never men went on ſervice with more chearfull coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances, than this Regiment did, going as it were, to welcome death, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be the paſſage unto life, eſpecially fighting in a good Cauſe, againſt the enemies of the Daughter of our King, the Queene of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> for whoſe ſake, our Magnificke and Royall Maſter did undertake the warres, and for her ſake, we reſolved to have followed ſuch a couragious Leader, as the Earth this day affords none ſtouter, as mine eyes did witneſſe divers times: And for her ſake, I perſwade my ſelfe, our noble <hi>Colonell</hi> did ingage his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and adventured his perſon, to have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>on her ſacred Majeſty good ſervice. I did alſo obſerve this day, that the beſt way to eſchew danger, is not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it; for a man well reſolved perceives no danger, neither doth any thing ſeeme difficult unto him, that may import his credit. And the beſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, in my opinion, as they are in meaſure remiſſe, not ſeeming prodigall of their lives, though reſolutely adventurous; and for me, I love a man that is modeſtly valiant, that ſtirres not till he muſt needs: for he that is conſcious of his inward courage, is confident to ſhew it to the world, when he will; but a man prodigall of life, oft-times indangers himſelfe and others; for though he have courage to lead them on, he lacks wit and diſcretion to bring them off, in caſe of eminent danger. And at ſuch times, as I condemne him that runnes away firſt, I cannot allow of him, that, out of oſtentation, will ſtay after all his <hi>Camerades</hi> are gone, till he yeeld himſelfe priſoner, or die un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſarily there, where he might have preſerved himſelfe with honour for a better occaſion. I have alſo obſerved, that a baſe fellow hath been killed running away, when a valiant Souldier ſtood to it, and came off with credit.</p>
               <p>I did alſo remarke the invincible courage and reſolution of that worthy Gentleman Lievtenant <hi>Roſſe,</hi> who having loſt his legge, wiſhed for a wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den or Treen legge, lying on the ground, as the example of pittie, that he, who was indued with ſuch courage, and Chriſtian reſolution, had not time in the warfare, to have given the world greater proofe of his valour.</p>
               <p>Here alſo I muſt condemne thoſe arrogant Spirits, who contemne <hi>God</hi> and Fate, that while as being on ſervice, and being hurt, may retire with cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and on the contrary will be ſo fooliſhly valiant, as to ſtay on a ſecond hurr, worſe than the firſt; as became that day of a young Gentleman of my name, and kindred, who being ſhot in the Arme with a musket bullet, would not at my deſire retire, but ſlighting his wound ſtayed on ſervice, till he was ſhot dead in the head. <hi>David Monro</hi> Enſigne,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="S"/> being ſhot through the body above the left pappe, went a little aſide, till he was dreſt, and returned againe to his Station, keeping his Colours in his hand, till night, before the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, never fainting with his wound, an example of rare courage, and of great ſtrength of bodie, neither did he ever thereafter keepe bed or lodging one houre, more than ordinary, for all this hurt.</p>
               <p>Here alſo I did obſerve, that the former diſtractions amongſt the Officers of the Regiment were taken away, having been companions of equall dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger againſt their enemies, made them love one another the better ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: for Captaine <hi>Iohn Monro,</hi> helped Lievetenant colonell <hi>Seaton,</hi> being ſhot,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:132555:21"/>to his horſe, having on the march two dayes before fallen horribly out: which verifies the <hi>Scots Proverbe, Dogges will part Swine,</hi> and make them agree amongſt themſelves. We ſee oft-times, that thoſe that are feebleſt themſelves, are moſt ready to ſpeake <hi>Derogatively</hi> of others. Here I might inferre divers inſtances, yet I will inferre, and onely point, for the preſent a little at thoſe unluckie diſpoſitions, that cannot endure any but themſelves to be well thought of, for if one be juſtly praiſed, or advanced in recompence of his vertue, they will preſently diſmount his vertues, and ſtabbe him to the heart, <hi>obnubilating</hi> his brighteſt glory, with a <hi>Butt</hi> of <hi>Detraction</hi> bred of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie, naſtie indeficient minds deviſing ſpots, where they find them not, a baſe office to make his tongue whip a worthy man. If I knew vice in another, I would nobly ſhew my charitie in concealing it, if he be abſent; if preſent, I would not flatter: for the valiant man his tongue is ever the greateſt coward in abſence, for it is not good to deprave the fame of the abſent, with a vipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Tongue: Therefore my advice were to thee, in ſuch a caſe, to doe like the wiſe man, to learne ſomewhat by thine enemies outrage, as King <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> learned well the leſſon, who many times thanked his enemies for their outrage, which made him afterwards the more wiſe, more circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and more ſetled: for nothing gives a man more good experience, than warres, lawes, love, and detraction: And for Detraction thou oughteſt to be ſo wiſe, if thou be made the marke for <hi>Calumniators</hi> to ſhoot at, let them ſhoot, as they pleaſe, I would be hard, they ſhould not pierce me. Being armed with a good Conſcience, we ſhould not care for their ſhooting, for though it ſometime take root in the eares of ſome hearers, yet thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort ſhould be, that one day, he ſhall kill himſelfe, ſoone or late, as the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable birth kils the mother: and ſuch fellows ſhould be puniſhed, as theeves: ſeeing the one bereaves men but of their ſubſtance, but the other bereaves them of life, and death, and of their deareſt friends alſo. And he ſhould be holden as ſuch a one himſelfe, till he brought his evidence; as the cuſtome was of old: and for my ſelfe, I never found better remedie againſt them, than to diſdaine them, as coming about the eares of a deafe man, that did not heare them, and this I found to be the beſt bridle, to curbe their tongues, for in the end he would hold his peace, and turne his tongue another way: but I muſt confeſſe, the tongue of a <hi>Calumniatour</hi> hath ſometimes offended me, and grieved me much, but they profited me, in making me the more circumſpect and diligent, in thinking on all circumſtances, that might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve my credit and reputation, to be avenged on them. And with the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbe,</hi> which I know to be true, I will conclude this point, things that grieve us, ſhould lead us to repentance, ſeeing that which deſtroyes, inſtructs; and <hi>God</hi> oft-times, cleanſes the inward man, by the outward, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary courſe, leading us to our wiſhed for Harbour: for there is no ſuch great diſcommoditie, but brings commoditie with it; for thoſe that are ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by <hi>Scorpions,</hi> though at firſt it be very dangerous, yet at laſt, the hurt being cured by convenient remedies, it brings fruit with advantage, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience hath taught, neither Flie, Bee, nor Waſp can harme thoſe thus cured.</p>
               <p>To conclude then this point of Detraction,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="T"/> men ſhould be circumſpect, what to determine of other mens actions, being on ſervice: for I am of the opinion, that in time of hot ſervice, no man doth remember the halfe of his other actions, much leſſe to remarke the actions of others, except ſome
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:132555:21"/>circumſtances, which he may remember. Therefore we ſhould be loath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſarily to bring our ſelves in queſtion, in ſpeaking evill of others: for commonly, at ſuch times, cowards, or feeble men, that are not in action themſelves, ſee more than others that are better employed: yet the feeble man is ever readieſt to detract, for to prevent his owne inſufficiency, too well knowne to others. But after this dayes ſervice, our detractions, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions alſo, were almoſt taken away, being companions of the like dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, againſt our enemies: And I inferred this diſcourſe of detraction, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that at ſuch ſervice commonly men doe ſpeake, as they doe favour, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as their envie carries them; which fault as being too much in uſe in all eſtates, eſpecially amongſt Souldiers, I would wiſh from my heart that it might be eſchewed.</p>
               <p>Here alſo I obſerved, that want of circumſpection in command, eſpecially over young Souldiers, as we had to command, doe many times cauſe great inconveniences to follow, as was ſeen in the blowing up of our powder, whereby our <hi>Colonell</hi> was burnt in the face, and many more. Here I might ſpeake ſomewhat of the hurt and inconveniency, that doth happen many times by Cannon, and powder, but I will referre it to a fitter place, to be ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe I cannot here omit to ſpeake ſomewhat of the reſolution of ſome particular Souldiers, that were hurt on this ſervice. <hi>Hector Monro</hi> of <hi>Cool,</hi>


                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> being ſhot through one of his feet, was deſired to goe off, who anſwered, it was not time, till firſt he had emptied his Bandeliers againſt his enemies, before which time he was ſhot through the other foot alſo, and then was not able to come off alone, without helpe of others, and ſome of his <hi>Camerades,</hi> which helpt him off, going farther with him than he thought needfull for his ſafetie, or their credit, he wiſhed them to retire, and diſcharge their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties againſt the enemy, as they had ſufficiently done towards him. <hi>Hugh Murrey</hi> being deſired in time of hot ſervice, to goe and take off his brother being killed; he lacking powder ſaid, going towards his dead brother, I will firſt emptie my brothers Bandeliers, as I have done mine owne, to be revenged on his enemies, before I take him off: in the meane time, he was ſhot in the eye himſelfe, and that wondrous favourably, the Bullet ſome few dayes after having come forth at his noſe, which is moſt true, though ſeeming incredible. This day alſo I obſerved an ill cuſtome too common to all Generals, that they make moſt uſe, in time of deſperate ſervice, of thoſe that doe beſt ſerve them, and when once they have experience of their valour, they never omit to employ them on the moſt dangerous exploits; and for reward, they onely doe commend their valour, when others are ſcarce remembred at all.</p>
               <p>Here alſo I did ſee, that on hot ſervice,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="W"/> nothing can be more comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, than the getting of a timely reliefe, as we did get of the reſt of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, for having long ſmarted under the mercy of Cannon and Musket, in hot ſervice, ſo that a Souldier was not able to handle his Musket for feare of burning, having ſhot ſo oft, till his ſhoulder did ake; who can thinke, but to ſuch a one a reliefe was welcome: truely I thinke no man that hath his foot in the fire, but would gladly take it out: yet I perſwade my ſelfe, there were ſome here, who would ſuffer to burne before they retired with diſgrace, or diſcredit, their honour being ſo deare unto them. The beſt proofes a Souldier can inferre of his valiant courage, are his wounds got
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:132555:22"/>with credit, not running away, and the beſt exhortation a Leader can give common Souldiers is, to ſhew himſelfe couragious, and then, without words, with a ſigne, ſome will follow him, in imitating his example.</p>
               <p>Here alſo I did obſerve, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> are not the beſt Souldiers in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie of danger, though I confeſſe for the diſcharge of all dutie, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe very obedient, till it come to extremitie, and then commonly they make a Cloake of diſcontentment, and call for money, as they did this day. Likewiſe I cannot ſay, but Horſe-men are uſefull many times, as they were here; yet in my opinion, in their ſervice, they are not to be paralleld to foot: For at the in-taking of Townes, and in hilly and mountainous Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, that are ſtraight by nature, they are not uſefull, neither can they doe but little ſervice, yet for their great charges, they are much harder to be entertained: Therefore my choice ſhall be ever, as moſt credible to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand on foote, and if I were worthy to adviſe a King, or a Generall follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing warres, I would wiſh him to eſteeme more of his foot Officers, than of his horſe: then fewer ſhould ſerve on horſebacke, and more on foote; and as his Charges ſhould be leſſe, his profit ſhould be the more, his Armie the ſtronger, his Countrey leſſe ſpoyl'd, his contribution to maintaine his Armie, the better payd, his treaſure richer, his Victories more frequent, and more durable, his Conqueſt the better maintained.</p>
               <p>This I dare preſume to affirme to be all true, out of my little experience, and which is more, all the time I have ſerved, where I have heard one fault imputed to a body of foote, I could inſtance ten defects in our Horſemens ſervice: for the worſt ſort of them being too much given to plowndring, makes them neglect their duties, which fault alſo is too Common amongſt many of their Leaders, though I have knowne ſome honeſt men amongſt them free from this imputation: and for a King, or Prince, that muſt defend his Countrie, by ſea, (as our noble Mr: the King of <hi>Dennarke</hi> was) I would adviſe him, as unprofitable for his ſervice and country, not to encertaine ſtrangers in this kinde, ſo being their charges would far ſurmount the benefit that could redound by their ſervice, yet I cannot ſay, but the <hi>Rhinegrave</hi> his Regiment was the only Regiment under the King at this time, that did beſt ſervice, which was ever praiſe worthy.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe, I have found by experience that thoſe who fight beſt in occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> have ever the beſt of it, though they chance to ſuffer loſſe, if it come to a retreat, commonly they are moſt reſpected and come firſt off, as we did at this time, and it is ever better to fight well, and to retire timely, then for a man to ſuffer himſelfe to be taken priſoner, as many were that morning after our retreat: and in occaſions, I rather chooſe to die honourably, then to live and to be priſoner to a churliſh fellow, that perhaps would keepe me in perpetuall bondage, as many brave men are kept; or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, at my taking, to be ſcurvely uſed, being ſtript naked by a Villaine, and then, if I lacked monies about me, to be cut and carved, and at laſt, poorely put to death, being naked without Armes to defend my ſelfe. My adviſe then is to him that cannot reſolve to fight well, that he reſolve accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his ſtation, and charge, to be well furniſhed of money, not onely about him, but alſo, to have money to the beſt in a ſure place, and in ſure hands to maintaine him, being priſoner, and to pay his ranſome; or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, let him reſolve to remaine in perpetuall bondage, except ſome noble friend or other have compaſſion on him.</p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:132555:22"/>
               <p>Likewiſe I would adviſe all worthy Souldiers, and Officers going on ſervice, if they can, never to want ſome monies about them, that, if they chance to come as priſoners in undiſcreete hands, they may caſt a bone in the doggs teeth, to curry favour of the cruell curre.</p>
               <p>I did alſo obſerve here, that continency is a vertue very neceſſary for a Souldier, for abſtaining from many inordinate appetites, that followe his profeſſion, that he may the better ſuffer hunger, cold, thirſt, nakedneſſe, travell, toyle, heate, and what elſe patiently, never mutining for any defect: for it is the greateſt victory we can attaine unto, to overcome our ſelves, and our appetites. Likewiſe I did obſerve, that Kings, and Generalls are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry courteous to Cavaliers, while as they ſtand in neede of their ſervice,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> in making their uſe of them, but the occaſion once paſt, oft times they do looke on Cavaliers at a diſtance, as if they had not imployment for them; which ſhould teach Cavaliers, to take their time with reaſon of their Maſters alſo; and then they might care the leſſe for them (being ſtrangers or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Kings) while as, they would diſdaine them, having ſtill a ſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate to their owne King, and Maſter. Here alſo I found that a friend in neede was better then gold, for had not the Duke of <hi>Wymar</hi> beene our friend we had bin left behinde at the paſſe, and beene priſoners the next day with the reſt of the Army. It is therefore ever beſt to do well, come after what may; for vertue in deſpight of envy, will not want a reward: And a ſtout Marriner that hath ridden out the ſtorme with loſſe, as we did this day, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyces in the calme, when it comes; and he is ſaid to merit the Crowne, that hath fought valiantly.</p>
               <p>It is alſo very neceſſary, that at ſuch ſervice, as this was, if we have time, that we be carefull, to bring off our Camerades bodies killed on ſervice, that died honourably before their enemies, to be laid in the bed of honour, in burying their bodies, as becomes Chriſtians. We are alſo tied in duety to our Camerades, that were with us in danger, if either they be woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or mutilated, to care for their ſafeties, ſo far as lieth in our power: And we muſt not preferre the ſafety of our owne bodies, to the publique weale of our Camerades, and countrimen dead or living, but we ought, with the hazard of our owne lives, to bring off the dead and hurt.</p>
               <p>An example of this duety, we have in the perſon of the Preſident of <hi>Chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſangne</hi> treating of the <hi>Iewes</hi> law, that did command, that the bodies of their dead enemies ſhould not lie unburied. <hi>Caſar</hi> cauſed to be buried the head of his enemy <hi>Pompey,</hi> and wept at his death, as <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports in his fift booke, and ſixt Chapter.


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Y"/>
                  <hi>Hercules</hi> is thought to have bin the firſt that ordained to bury the bodies of thoſe killed on ſervice, and <hi>David</hi> calls them bleſſed, that were ſo thankefull, as to have buried <hi>Saul. Iudas Macchabie</hi> did cauſe to bury the bodies of the enemy killed in battaile, and <hi>Alexander</hi> reſtored unto the mother of <hi>Darius</hi> the dead bodie of her ſonne, <hi>Hanniball</hi> did burie, the body of his enemy <hi>Marcellus,</hi> as <hi>Valerius</hi> affirmes. It is alſo expedient, for the common-weale, that the bodies of the dead be buried: and <hi>Leonard Darez</hi> reports that <hi>Cyrus, Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Cæſar</hi> did recommend their funeralls to their friends, as Lievetenant <hi>Roſſe</hi> did his to his Captaine and me, which we performed in the beſt manner we could, for the time. If <hi>Pagans</hi> had ſuch regard to their burialls, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſhould be more carefull, whoſe bodies ſometimes were the recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the holy Spirit, and of the immortall ſoule created to Gods owne Image.</p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:132555:23"/>
               <p>Here alſo I would report the commandement that we reade in the ſecond chapter verſe 23. of the fourth booke of <hi>Eſdras. Where thou findeſt the dead, put them in the grave</hi> (with a certaine marke) <hi>and I will give thee the firſt ſeate in my reſurrection:</hi> and the wiſe Ancients ſaid, men ſhould looke unto the end. My exhortation then is to all my worthy countrimen, and women, that were intereſſed in our loſſes in this dayes ſervice, to conſider, that when theſe gentlemen, and Cavaliers were borne, that they were marked and ordained to die honourably, fighting in the good cauſe; and for the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our Kings daughter, the Queene of <hi>Bohemia</hi> and her diſtreſſed Royall Iſſue, under the magnanimous King of <hi>Denmarke</hi> our Maſter, who for her Majeſties libertie, did hazard not onely his life, but his crowne; let them then that are intereſſed, as ſaid is, in this our loſſe conſider againe, that they died with great honour, and reputation, ſeeing they live eternally in their fame, having laid downe their lives, as ſervants of the publique, if not for their country, yet at leaſt, as cannot be denied, for the liberty of their Kings Royall Iſſue: It then became them well, to have died ſtanding. Therefore thoſe mothers,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Z"/> friends, or Siſters, are to be condemned, that mourne for them that live (after their death) in their fame, and though their griefe be great, let them ſhed no teares, for feare it become of them, as became of that Ancient woman called <hi>Vicia,</hi> mother to <hi>Futius Geminus,</hi> who was killed at <hi>Rome,</hi> for having wept at the death of her ſonne, that had loſt his life in the publique ſervice, as reporteth <hi>Tacitus</hi> in his 6 booke of his <hi>Annals,</hi> and our Saviour in the Evangeliſt Saint <hi>Luke</hi> doth forbid the widdow to weepe for her ſonne that was dead, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> ſaith, <hi>Brethren I would not have you ignorant of the eſtate of thoſe that are aſleepe,</hi> to the end you do not over-mourne, as thoſe do, that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope. Therefore, let us forbeare all teares for thoſe departed, and if we ſhould mourne, let us mourne with teares, even thoſe moſt pretious teares for ſinne, theſe are the Chriſtian teares, that ſhould be ſhed from our hearts, to reconcile us unto God, thoſe teares are as the bloud of the ſoule, hurt and wounded with the ſenſe, and feeling of our ſinnes, before God theſe are the teares, that drawe Gods mercy upon us, as <hi>David</hi> cried unto God in the 56 <hi>Pſalme.

               <p>HEre we ſee that the loſſe of a day,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Z"/> is the loſſe of a great part of his Majeſties Kingdome: for the loſſe of his Armie was the loſſe of <hi>Holſten</hi> and <hi>Yewtland,</hi> ſo that here below we have no aſſured eſtate, from the King to the Clowne, whereof we have frequent examples in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, which ſhould make none of all eſtates to glory too much, either in their peace, or proſperitie, as the <hi>Holsteners</hi> did: for though now thou be in peace and ſecuritie, as they were before this day, thou oughtſt to looke unto thy ſelfe, and to prevent the worſt better than they did.</p>
               <p>Therefore to diſcharge a part of my dutie to my Country-men and friends, I minde here ſomewhat to touch the miſery of man through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy of humane affaires. <hi>Iſidore</hi> writes, that it was the cuſtome at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> in the dayes of the Emperours Coronation, while as he ſate in his Throne, a <hi>Maſon</hi> came to him, preſenting ſtones, that he might chooſe which he would to make his Tombe of, thereby putting him in minde of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy of humane fragilitie. We reade alſo of a ſimple Citizen in <hi>Italy,</hi> that became one of the moſt powerfull men in <hi>Italy,</hi> and coming to the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of a Prince, being thirtie yeares, without interruption, in great proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, tranquillitie and peace, yea ever in the moſt dangerous time of warre, and his Children raiſed to high honours and dignities; this man thinking himſelfe to be above the winde, a whirle-winde of warres, unlooked for, came on him and his from <hi>Florence,</hi> that he with his wife and children were taken priſoners, and ſent to <hi>Millane,</hi> his goods conſiſcated, he was ſhut up in cloſe priſon, and died miſerably: the <hi>Venetians</hi> appropriating unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves all his money he had in Bancke.</p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:132555:24"/>
               <p>We reade alſo of one <hi>Francis Force,</hi> that through his heaping up of wealth came to be made Duke of <hi>Millane,</hi> and after that intitled himſelfe to be the Sonne of <hi>Fortune,</hi> and the Oracle of the Princes of <hi>Italie,</hi> being many yeares in proſperitie, was afterwards chaſed from his goods, as the <hi>Holsteners</hi> were then, but having recovered his lands and goods againe, he grew ſo inſolent and proud of his proſperitie, that at laſt he was taken priſoner, and was kept till death in priſon; mockt of the whole world, for his pride and greedineſſe. The ſame Author <hi>Guicchardine</hi> in his ſeventh Booke in the 157, doth record of the <hi>Bentioles</hi> chaſed out of <hi>Bullon,</hi> where they long were in peace, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of <hi>Millane</hi> being forbidden to receive them, the chiefeſt of them died of griefe, having never before taſted the Cup of adverſitie: And ſo became of ſundry in <hi>Denmark,</hi> that for feare did ſend away their goods by ſhipping unto the <hi>Craggs</hi> of <hi>Norway,</hi> to be kept there, whereof ſome were loſt by Sea, and the owners afterward died of griefe, not having the courage to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe patiently their Croſſe. <hi>The Lord of his mercie preſerve my Countrey and Friends from the like Viſitation.</hi> Let no man therefore flatter himſelfe with proſperitie, riches, or honour, as <hi>Agapetus</hi> adviſeth us in his <hi>Politique Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſmes.</hi> All are borne alike, come of duſt, our glory then ſhould be of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and not in riches, proſperitie, or honours; for we ſhould eſteeme of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much, as of <hi>Gods</hi> judgements, praying his Majeſtie continually to divert them from us, eſteeming more of our ſoules, than of deceivable ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, whereof the poſſeſſion is uncertaine, as was ſeene at this time, both in <hi>Holſten</hi> and <hi>Yewtland,</hi> their riches went faſter away than they came, and though they could have enjoyed them, yet at laſt they were forced to leave them to others. Since therefore we can carry nothing with us, but our good name, let us be ever carefull of that, diſcharging, ſo farre as we may, with a good Conſcience our dutie to God and man, and this Heritage we cannot be robbed of, though the world ſhould turne to nothing.</p>
               <p>Here we ſee this <hi>magnanimous</hi> King his eſtate falling for his love to his Niece, the diſtreſſed Queene of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and her Children,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ſeeing her bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from her Kingdome by the ſword of her enemies, he hazards the loſſe of his Crowne and perſon, to get her reſtored, bringing the ſword of his enemies within his owne Countrey, fortune having croſſed him abroad: yet for all this, this <hi>Magnanimous</hi> King was not dejected, but with a coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious reſolution makes uſe of the time, retiring to one corner of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to prevent the loſſe of the whole, being naturally fortified with a broad graffe, as the Iſle of <hi>Britaine;</hi> being ſtrong of ſhipping, having his Majeſtie of <hi>Britaine</hi> to friend, and the Eſtates of the united Provinces, he was careleſſe of the Emperours forces by Sea or Land, not being able to harme his Majeſtie more than they did.</p>
               <p>By this example we may ſee, what advantage our Soveraigne, the Kings Majeſtie of great <hi>Britaine,</hi> hath over all forraigne Kings in <hi>Europe,</hi> through the ſcituation of his Dominions, being mightie in power of men, ſhipping, and money, is able to make warre abroad, where he pleaſeth, and to make a ſafe Retreat, when he pleaſeth, being Maſter at Sea, as he can eaſily be, terrifying his enemies with one Armie abroad, and a ſtrong Armie at Sea, he can offend whom he will, and retire when he liſt, forcing all <hi>Europe</hi> to be in feare of him, and his Majeſtie in feare of none, but of the King of Kings. The Lord therefore preſerve his Majeſtie, his Children and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, from the power of forraigne enemies; and I wiſh a great part of my
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:132555:25"/>friends and Country-men were ſo farre addicted, to ſeeke the reſtitution of her Majeſtie of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and her Royall Iſſue, as I am; the warres then ſhould never end, till they were reſtored, and I avenged of my friends bloud, and mine owne, ſhed in the quarrell.</p>
               <p>Here alſo I did obſerve his Majeſties circumſpection, in preventing the <hi>Emperialiſts,</hi> in coming by water unto his Kingdome, having beſet all <hi>Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> with ſtrong <hi>Garriſons</hi> of Horſe and Foote, which kept ſtrong guards, and good watch by night and by day, at ſuch places on the Coaſt, as was moſt in danger of the enemies over-ſetting, till in the end, the enemy was forced to retire his Armie, leaving but a few men in Garriſon in the Townes, which lay on the Coaſt, which Garriſons his Majeſtie with ſhipping did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten viſite, to their great hurt, with ſtrong parties, retiring againe, having done his exployt,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> at his pleaſure in ſafetie. This <hi>Magnanimous</hi> King, to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, deſerved to have been worthily thought of, and well ſpoken of, for his noble enterprizing of the warre, being Leader and Generall in ſo good a cauſe. And though the ſucceſſe was not anſwerable, I dare be bold to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, it was none of his Majeſties fault, for his Majeſtie not onely beſtowed much in advancing of it, but alſo did hazard himſelfe and his Crowne in maintaining of it. Nevertheleſſe, there are alwayes ſome Cynicks, that doe barke at his Majeſties proceedings, without reaſon; where we may ſee, that no man, no nor Kings themſelves can eſcape the laſh of cenſure, and none can eſchew to be traduced by the ignominious aſperſions of the male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent tongue. Therefore it is good to doe well, and then we need not care what is ſaid; except the ſayer put his name to his aſſertion, and then he may be made to foote his Boule, in maintaining of it, or unworthily to refuſe it. Here alſo I did obſerve, that no Armour nor paſſe could remove the Generalls feare; for having once imagined the enemies over-coming, he was never fully ſetled, till he was ſafe a ſhip-board. And therefore I did ſee at this time that verified, that when man diſtruſteth God, it is then juſt with God to leave man to himſelfe: for after our Retreat, being on the Roade, the Generall, being thronged in his owne Ship, could not command a Ship to tranſport his ſervants, till I forced a Ship for his Excellencies ſervice; which ſhould teach all men in Authoritie, while they have command, to command with diſcretion, leſt the wheele ſhould turne, and then they ſhould be beholding to thoſe, whom before they commanded.</p>
               <p>Here alſo I did ſee mutinous Souldiers well rewarded, and it may be ſooner than they thought; for the day before thoſe that call'd for money when they were commanded to goe on ſervice, the next day I being a Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board did ſee them turne ſlaves unto their enemies being taken priſoners, robbed both of Cloaths and money, and kept long in bondage, being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſerve againſt their Conſcience, ſuch was their folly in calling for money when it was no time to tell it. Having at this time left our horſes and baggage to our enemies, I obſerved ſomewhat on the love of men to thoſe beaſts, and the love of beaſts to their Maſters, as worth the noting, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the kindneſſe that ſhould be entertained amongſt Chriſtians, and men of one profeſſion;


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> my brother <hi>Obſtell,</hi> of worthy memory, had a Horſe of our owne Country-breed, that was ſo familiarly acquainted with his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and with the noiſe and touch of Drumme, that the whole day on our march, when his Maſter went a foote, he unled followed the Drumme a little aſide from the Company, halting when they halted, and moving when
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:132555:25"/>they moved faſt or ſlow. Another Horſe I left, that being in <hi>Wiſmer Leager,</hi> having rode out one day to a wood, halfe a mile from the Leager, to cauſe to cut timber, leaving my Horſe ſtanding alone, and my Cloake on my Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, a Rutter coming by, unknowne to me and my fellowes, ſteales my Horſe away, who finding himſelfe in ſtrangers hands, skips looſe, and runs to our Leager, being chaſ't and hunted at by more than a hundred Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, out-runs them all unto the trenches, and running through the Leager, ſtands before my Tent, my Camerades wondering what became of mee, thinking I had been killed by the Horſemen, come and make ſearch for me, and finding me, tell me of my Horſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe beaſts I have remembred for their love, for which I will ſet downe ſome particulars concerning the addreſſe, fidelitie, and bountie of ſome Horſes; whereof I have formerly read. <hi>Plinie</hi> proteſts their prayſes cannot be expreſſed. We reade of the <hi>Numidians,</hi> that were ſo much redoubted of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> that in their warres, they would at ſpurres, runne their Horſes in middeſt of their enemies, without a bridle to governe them. In the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile of <hi>Cannes, Hanniball</hi> returning the next day on the place of Battaile, to looke more narrowly to the place, a <hi>Romane</hi> Knight halfe dead, hearing the noiſe of people, lifted up his head, of purpoſe to have ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but his voice failing, died: with the laſt gaſpe, by <hi>Hanniball</hi> there roade a <hi>Numidian</hi> on that dead Knights Horſe, who knowing his Maſter, begun to move his eares, to bray, and to leape, and rebound with ſuch fury, till he caſts the <hi>Numidian</hi> to ground, runnes through the dead bodies, and ſtands before his dead Maſter, and leaning downe his necke and ſhoulders, ſheweth the deſire he had that his Maſter ſhould leape on him, to the great aſtoniſhment of <hi>Hanniball,</hi> and his followers. We reade alſo in the warres of <hi>Germanie,</hi> in the yeare 1176 the Dukes of <hi>Saxon</hi> forced by Armes to ſubmit themſelves to the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, giving the Emperour for pledges of their fidelitie, two yong Princes, Sonnes to a Marqueſſe, which were carefully kept in a Caſtle, that was very ſtrong, the Captaine whereof moved by Compaſſion, and wonne by ſome preſents, ſuffered them ſometimes to goe abroad to take the ayre, and to ride their Horſes thereabout: The Captaine going a hunting, takes theſe young youths with him, the prey found and hunted, ſhee is followed by all, not thinking of any other thing: The youths ſpurring hard out of ſight, follow their courſe till they come to the River of the <hi>Maine,</hi> where they requeſt a Fiſherman to tranſport them in his little Cane or Boate to <hi>Mentz,</hi> offering him their little ſcarlet Cloakes for pay: The Fiſherman helpes them from their Horſes, and takes them in his Boate, and rowes downe the River, their Horſes ſwimming after them to <hi>Mentz,</hi> where they and their Horſes were graciouſly welcomed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plinie</hi> writes, that Horſes wept at their Maſters deaths, and it is recorded, that the Horſe of <hi>Cæſar</hi> wept: foretelling his Maſters death, and I perſwade my ſelfe, the gentle Reader could adde ſomewhat to this purpoſe, if he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, but thus farre to animate Chriſtians to love, reſpect, and cheriſh their <hi>Camerades,</hi> and not to kill and backbite them,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> as too many are too ready to detract from others, to adde to themſelves: a wrong way; for honour is compared well to a chaſte Maide, that will never love them who would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh her, but being courted ſhee may be moved.</p>
               <p>Here I muſt not forget that dutie I owe to the remembrance of that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy young Gentleman, <hi>Arthur Forbeſſe,</hi> Sonne to a worthy <hi>Cavalier,</hi> of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:132555:26"/>memory, Lievetenant Colonell <hi>Arthur Forbeſſe,</hi> being a worthy valou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſonne, deſcended of a valiant Father. This young Gentleman being deadly wounded on ſervice, and with hazard brought unto our Ship, within two dayes dyed. Likewiſe a Gentleman borne in the Iſles of <hi>Scotland,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Alexander Mac-Worche,</hi> being wounded in the head, and ſhot in the arme, the enemies Horſemen ſhooting at him with Piſtols, he leapes from the ſhoare, with his cloathes on, notwithſtanding thoſe wounds, and ſwimmes to my Coſen Captaine <hi>Monro</hi> his Boate, and being brought in died the next day, and was much lamented for of his <hi>Camerades,</hi> as a Gentleman of great hope.</p>
               <p>I did alſo obſerve here, the inconvenience that happens to many brave Officers and Souldiers given to plundering, gathering together a little boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie for ſpending, which brings them commonly into their enemies hands, their puniſhment being farre more grievous, than their purchaſe was delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and yet I thinke, the Guilt is worſe than the puniſhment. To which purpoſe I will onely here inferre one Story. A <hi>Pythagorian</hi> bought a paire of ſhooes upon truſt, the ſhooe-maker dyes, the Philoſopher is glad, and thinks them gaine, but a while after his Conſcience touches him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a perpetuall chider, he repaires to the houſe of the dead, caſts in his money with theſe words; <hi>There take thy due, thou liveſt to me, though dead to all beſides.</hi>


                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Certainly, in my opinion, ill gotten gaines are farre worſe than loſſes with preſerved honeſtie. Theſe grieve but once, the others are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually grating upon our quiet, and he diminiſhes his owne contentment, that would adde unto it by unlawfulneſſe; for looking onely to the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, he thinkes not of the end. But in my opinion, if plundering, or making of bootie, at any time be excuſable for a Souldier, it is onely in reſpect of the circumſtances. Our friends being forced to quit their Countrey and their goods to their enemies, before it ſhould inrich the enemy, it were not amiſſe to take it, or deſtroy it either with fire or water, before it were profitable to our enemies; and in this point onely I doe allow of this bootie making, providing it doe not hinder men from the diſcharge of their duties, in time and place: otherwiſe, our beſt goods, being impediments to the diſcharge of our honeſt dutie in our calling, are to be throwne away. And for mine owne part, a few bookes left by my friends, which mine enemy might have burnt, was all the bootie that ever I made: neither doe I repent me of my neglect in this point; having ſeene many make bootie, who had never the happineſſe to enjoy it long. His Majeſties care, in fore-ſeeing the ſafetie of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> merits praiſe: for by the preſervation of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> his Majeſtie, like a skilfull Gameſter, recovered againe all that he loſt. Therefore we ought never to grieve for any thing paſt, but for ſinne, and for that alwayes. And he ſpake well, that ſaid, <hi>He that hath himſelfe hath lost nothing.</hi>

               <p>The Major being killed, I having diſcharged the duty in his abſence, by my Colonels reſpect to me and his Majeſties favour, I had Patent given me, under his Majeſties hand and Seale, as Major to the Regiment: as likewiſe Captaine <hi>Lermond</hi> his company then at <hi>Luckſtad,</hi> being vacant, through the death of the Captaine at <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> was alſo diſpoſed unto me; and orders were given unto the Commiſſary, that muſtred us, according to my Patent to place me, as Sergeant-Major over the Regiment, which all duely obeyed by the Commiſſary, the Drummer Major, accompanied with the reſt of the Drummers of the Regiment, being commanded, beate a bancke in head of the Regiment. The Commiſſary having his Majeſties Patent in his hand, makes a ſpeech, ſignifying his Majeſties will unto all the Officers of the Regiment, and without any contradiction placed me Segeant Major, and delivering me my Patent takes me by the hand, as the Colonell did, Lieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-Colonell with the whole Officers of the Regiment, wiſhing me joy, with the generall applauſe of the whole <hi>Soldateska,</hi> which ceremony ended,

But the Souldiers coming into a good fat ſoyle, clad themſelves honeſtly, which made them want com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe clothes; Yet none of us could ſay, but we ſerved a liberall, and a bountifull Maſter: the money firſt payed by the Commiſſaries, they give orders in his Majeſties name for keeping of good diſcipline over the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereby the <hi>Boores</hi> ſhould not complaine on the Souldiers Iſolencie, which they needed not to uſe, getting willingly from the <hi>Boores</hi> both meate, and mony, with ſome clothes: Nevertheleſſe, there were alwayes amongſt the one and the other, ſome churliſh Raſcalls, that cauſed complaints to be heard which made our proforce or Gavileger get company and money, for diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging his duety: for neither Officer, nor Souldier eſcaped due puniſhment, that was once complained on, untill ſuch time, as his Majeſtie was ſatisfied with juſtice, and the party offended.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> much worſe then it was, the people were ſo afraid, and ſo fearefull, that they enjoyed nothing without a frighted minde, no not their ſleepe: they trembled at the preſent miſeries that might but come, they were anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a more horrid habit, then any enemy could put them unto, meeting with evill before it came, making things but probable as certaine, as when one may ſit even in a boate, he is in no danger, yet through feare ſtirring, he may drowne himſelfe, and others, as we ſee often in battell that the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant man conſtantly keeping his ranke, doth live, when as the feeble cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard by ſtooping thinking to ſave his life, he loſes it; when the brave ſoule knowes no trembling. <hi>Cæſar</hi> ſpake like <hi>Cæſar,</hi> when he bad the Marriners feare nothing. And this invincible and Magnanimous King, though ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled by <hi>Cæſar,</hi> yet he encourages his ſubjects, by exhorting them to feare no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, going at all times himſelfe betwixt them and all dangers, he being the firſt many times ingaged, and the laſt coming off, caſting as it were, through his valour, a kinde of honour upon God; believing in his goodneſſe, caſting himſelfe in danger, truſting and confiding in his care onely. Not like an unworthy coward that eclipſes his ſufficiency, unworthily doubting that God will bring him off, unjuſtly accuſing God, his power or his will, making himſelfe his owne Saviour, he becomes his owne confounder.</p>
               <p>But this magnanimous King ſetting his care upon God, and uſing the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meanes, for his country, and kingdomes preſervation, winning the love of God, and of his ſubjects, eſtabliſheth himſelfe, and his Throne in deſpight of his enemies. Here alſo I have obſerved that good ſervice done to a noble and liberall Maſter, as this King was, cannot be without reward: Therefore let the ſervant deſerve, and the Maſter will recompence, if he be ſuch a juſt Maſter as we ſerved, where both loved each others, for their generous worthineſſe. Who ever then is a ſervant, if he ſuppoſe his lot hard, let him thinke on the other part, that ſervice is nothing els but a free mans calling, and comfort himſelfe with the example of Kings, that are but ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants (though more ſplendid) for the common-weale; and as this King our royall Maſter ſerved for his country, let us that are ſervants ſerving ſtrangers ſerve truely where we ſerve, for our countries credit, our owne weale, and our eternall fame which muſt live after us. This magnanimous King through the experience he had of our former true ſervice, is deſirous to have more of our countrimen to ſerve him, as we may ſee by the new employment laid on our Colonell and his Officers; Alſo on divers other Noblemen of our country, to bring unto him three other Regiments as
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:132555:28"/>
                  <hi>Nideſdale, Spynie</hi> and <hi>Murckles</hi> Regiments, we being the firſt that ſhewed them the way to be employed by his Majeſty.</p>
               <p>Here I will exhort all brave Cavaliers, of minde to follow the laudable profeſſion of Armes, not to grudge, though their advancement or prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment come not at firſt, but with patience to awaite on Gods bleſſing, ſince preferment comes neither from the Eaſt, nor from the weſt. But it is the bleſſing of the Lord, given by man as the reward of vertue.</p>
               <p>Who ever then would be famous by preferment, let him firſt ſtudy to be diligent and vertuous in his calling, and then doubtleſſe God will diſpoſe of him as he thinketh beſt for his owne Glory.</p>
               <p>Here we ſee that the Barron of <hi>Fowles,</hi> of worthy memory, thought it no diſparagement at firſt to follow my Lord of <hi>Rhey</hi> and his Regiment, as a voluntier, till he had ſeene ſome ſervice, and attained unto ſome experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and then beginning with a company, coming at laſt with credit to be Colonell over horſe and foote, and that to animate others of his name, and kindred to follow his example, rather to live honourably abroade, and with credit, then to encroach (as many do) on their friends at home, as we ſay in <hi>Scotland,</hi> leaping at the halfe loafe, while as others through ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue live nobly abroade, ſerved with ſilver plate, and attendance.</p>
               <p>Officers of one Regiment ought to live as brethren together, not envying one anothers advancement, entertaining no other emulation, then the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation of vertue, every one ſerving truely in their Stations, till ſuch time occaſion may be offered, for their advancement by degrees: for though their patience may be the longer, their credits will be the more, and their contentments at laſt will make them forgo and forget their former toyle, and diſturbances having come to their propoſed marke, though not altogether to their wiſhed end.


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> Here alſo we ſee that good diſcipline is requiſite for keeping good order, that as vertue is rewarded; ſo vice may be puniſhed: as we may ſee by the inſtitution of the Emperiall lawes, whereof one we reade conſtitute by the Emperor <hi>Frederick</hi> the ſecond in the code of <hi>Iuſtinian,</hi> bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that the labourers of the ground might live peaceably with aſſurance o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all, ſtaying in their villages, labouring the ground, ſo that no man ſhould be ſo bold, as to preſume to take any ſuch men priſoners, or to offer them any violence in deſtroying their Beaſty all, or in takeing their goods from them, condemning them to death that did contemne, or violate his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Cyrus</hi> going to warre, commanded no man ſhould trouble the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers. <hi>Xerxes</hi> commanded the like, ſaying, the warres were againſt thoſe that caried Armes, not againſt Shepheards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Belliſarius</hi> that brave Commander under the Emperour <hi>Iuſtinian,</hi> was ſo ſtrict againſt ſouldiers that troubled the <hi>Boores,</hi> that the ſouldiers going by the fruityards durſt not throw downe one Apple, and for his good order kept, victualls were cheaper in the Campe then in Townes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Procopius</hi> in his third booke of the <hi>Gothes</hi> warres in <hi>Italy</hi> reports, that <hi>Totilas</hi> King of the <hi>Gothes</hi> obſerved the ſame ſtrict diſcipline in <hi>Italy,</hi> ſuffring the <hi>Boores</hi> untroubled, for paying the contribution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nicephor Gregorius</hi> affirmed, that while as in the front of an Army mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched inſolency and violence, orderly came in the reare defeate and ruine. And now a dayes the <hi>Turkes</hi> do obſerve ſtricter diſcipline in their Armies then Chriſtians do; in ſo much that their Captaines muſt not ſuffer their
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:132555:28"/>Souldiers to goe into Orchards or Vineyards, as they march by. And as order is neceſſary in an Army, ſo it is in a Regiment requiſit to be kept, and puniſhment alſo to be uſed, for baniſhing all villany from a Regiment, as Gluttony, Drunkeneſſe, Whoredome, Opreſſion, Playing, Diceing, Roaring, Swaggering: for it is not ſeemely that thoſe, who ſhould over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come others, ſhould ſuffer themſelves to be overcome with any ſuch notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous vices; neither ought a brave fellow to vaunt of his valour, ſince it is not tolerable to kill men with words, without coming unto blowes; But he that comports himſelfe modeſtly is to be commended.</p>
               <p>Here alſo we ſee that the Emulation and ſtrife begunne amongſt Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours and Officers of quality,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> brings at laſt the ſame amongſt their inferiours and followers; as was ſeene in the diſorders and quarrelling betwixt our Souldiers and the <hi>Rhinegraves</hi> horſemen, which was wiſely prevented and taken away by the wiſdome of their Commanders, that carried mutuall love and reſpect to each others: for the mutuall good deſerving of both Officers, which was the chiefe inſtrument of their reconcilement, and taking away of their jarres, and idle quarrelling, ariſing of oſtentation, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy fruit growing out of Dunghills, withering faſter then it groweth, their jarres thus once removed, thereafter our love waxed ſo great, that where we chanced both to be on one ſervice, as at <hi>Wolgast,</hi> where we ſtood in neede of helpe, the <hi>Rhinegraves</hi> Regiment, eſpecially Rutmaſter <hi>Hoomes</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God made our Retreate ſafe, as you ſhall heare in its owne place.</p>
               <p>Here alſo I cannot paſſe over with ſilence the love that ordinarily is ſeene betwixt Officers, and their followers: being once put under good diſcipline they will undergo any thing for love of their Commanders and Leaders, who have taken paines and diligence in excerciſing them in the perfect uſe of their Armes, and in leading them bravely on occaſions before their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, in making with exerciſe their bodies ſtrong, and their hearts valiant, then I ſay, what will they not undertake for the love of their Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders? Truely, I muſt confeſſe, they will ſtand a thouſand times more in awe to incurre their Officers wrath, whom once they loved through love, than in any wiſe, thorough feare of any puniſhment, that may be enjoyned unto them by Lawes: and if they love and reſpect their Officers, for feare to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, even in their Marches, for their Officers credits they will march ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly with Armes in their Rancks and Files, that you would thinke a whole Regiment well diſciplined, as this was, were all but one body, and of one motion, their eares obeying the command all as one, their eyes turning all alike, at the firſt ſigne given, their hands going to execution as one hand, giving one ſtroake, yea many ſtroakes all alike, ever readie to ſtrike, or hold up, as their Commander pleaſeth; and thus exerciſed they were, that their enemies in all Rancounters could not but duely praiſe them, calling them the <hi>Invincible old Regiment:</hi> which alwayes rancountred with them on all occaſions, ſo that <hi>Mac-Keyes</hi> name, was very frequent, through the glorious fame of this never-dying Regiment, never wrong'd by Fortune in their fame, though divers times, by their enemies valour, they ſuſtained both loſſe and hurt: but would to God, we had alwayes met man to man, or that our Army had conſiſted all of ſuch men, and ſuch Officers, whereof, I was the unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieft! If ſo had beene, our conqueſt had extended ſo farre,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> as the <hi>Romanes</hi> of old did extend the limits and borders of their Empire, which for my wiſh I would beſtow on the Prince <hi>Elector Palatine,</hi> borne by the <hi>Iewel of Europe,</hi>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:132555:29"/>the Queene of <hi>Bohemia</hi> his Royall Mother; and if it were at my diſtribution, he ſhould have all from the River <hi>Euphrates</hi> at the Eaſt, to the Ocean Sea at the Weſt, the fertilleſt part of <hi>Africke</hi> at the South, and the <hi>Rhine</hi> and the <hi>Danube</hi> at the North; and yet I durſt affirme, that his Grand-father King IAMES of bleſſed and never-dying memory, might merit a farre greater poſſeſſion for his Grand-childe, the Illuſtrious <hi>Prince Elector Palatine</hi> of the <hi>Rhine;</hi> and to have an Armie of ſuch men, under his command, to be aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on his enemies. I would wiſh their cloathes nor mine owne, came ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver off, till his enemies were made his footſtoole to tread on, or to ſhew mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, at his Highneſſe pleaſure: And for my wiſh, his Armie ſhould be all of <hi>Britaines, Dutch,</hi> and <hi>Iriſh,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Vegetius</hi> deſcribeth the <hi>Romane</hi> Souldiers of old: and I, as one though unworthieſt of a thouſand <hi>Britaine</hi> Officers, would undertake to make ſuch brave lads to dwell Summer and Winter in Tents, ever in readineſſe to fight with our enemies, and to endure all incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, for the credit of ſuch a Maſter, baniſhing far from him with vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant hands well armed, all the craft, power, and ſubtiltie that his enemies were able to deviſe againſt him: And we ſhould, for his ſake, be contented with ſuch allowance as the <hi>Emperiall</hi> Lawes allow a Souldier, being one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo much as might maintaine life, or ſo much as Beaſts get that are put to dyet, and we ſhould be content to march with ſuch expedition, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion, without quarter or Garriſon, as neede requireth, never ſtaying behinde, but alwayes advancing, conſenting willingly to undergoe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, if we did to the contrary: but to march ever orderly in Rancks, as the way lay rough or even, foule or faire, as our Colours and Leaders went before us; Never quitting our Rancks, but with licence, till the cauſe were wonne, or that our Maſters Throne were eſtabliſhed. And if otherwiſe we went aſtray, we ſhould be content to quit our allowance: and if this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline were not ſtrict enough, we ſhould be content to have his Highneſſe and <hi>Royall Mother</hi> reſtored, to doe as our Fathers did coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> marching alongſt the ſpacious and wide Deſert, that our Randezvouz might be appointed and ſet, till we arrived in <hi>Cades,</hi> that is to ſay, in the holy Land, where being victorious, we ſhould bid our Maſter farewell, and reſt with our Fathers.</p>

                  <hi>The ninth Dutie diſcharged of</hi> Major Dumbarre <hi>his Service at</hi> Bredenberg.</head>
               <p>THis noble Cavalier, of famous and worthy memory, having done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table good ſervice at <hi>Beyſenburg</hi> Skonce on the River of the <hi>Elve,</hi> as was formerly ſet downe, at his retiring to <hi>Lugstad,</hi> he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded with foure Companies of <hi>Scots,</hi> and certaine <hi>Dutch,</hi> the enemy having falne into <hi>Holſten,</hi> his order was to beſet the Caſtle of <hi>Bredenberg,</hi> being a paſſe, but not ſtrong, nor fortified <hi>in Forma.</hi> As I was informed by a valourous little Captaine, Captaine <hi>William Lumſdell,</hi> who then was <hi>Enſigne</hi> to the <hi>Major,</hi> who onely at that time eſcaped with his life, from the fury of the enemy, being within the houſe, while as the reſt, in the fury, were put to the ſword: This Gentleman who informed me, was with the Major wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king abroad neare to the houſe at the enemies firſt approaching, ſo that the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:132555:29"/>enemy unawares did come ſo neare, that they retiring to the Caſtle, had ſcarce time to draw up the draw-bridge, when the enemy with his forces, being, as was thought, ten thouſand ſtrong, led by <hi>Tilley,</hi> had the houſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed on all quarters. The enemy ſends a Trumpeter, ſummoning to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the place, which was refuſed. Whereupon they entred to approach, and the Defender reſiſts. The ſervice thus begun, <hi>Comoedian</hi>-like, ends very Tragically, the whole Court and lodgings running with bloud, with which the walles and pavement are ſprinkled with our <hi>Scottiſh</hi> bloud, to be viewed and ſeene to this day. To be particular in the diſcharge of this dutie at large, not having ſeene the ſervice, I will not, leſt I ſhould erre in giving notice un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, of things I did not know; but by report, which ordinarily holds not ſo true, as things we have both knowne and ſeene. In this houſe of <hi>Bredenberg</hi> there was a great number of men, women and children, beſides the Souldiers, that had taken their flight thither, as to a place of refuge, at the enemies firſt coming into the land. There was alſo in this houſe great ſtore of riches, belonging to the Lord of the houſe, and to the Fugitives, that was brought from the Country. The Major valourouſly defended the place for ſix dayes, untill the time they had approached unto the moate, and ſhot two ſeverall breaches in the wall, and being ſo neare, the enemy directed a <hi>Drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> unto the <hi>Major,</hi> to ſee if he would <hi>Parle;</hi> But the <hi>Drummer</hi> returned with an anſwer, that ſo long as there was bloud in <hi>Dumbarres</hi> head, that houſe ſhould never be given over: which anſwer ſo incenſed the enemy againſt them, that they ſware, if they got the upper hand over them, they ſhould all die without quarters. Shortly after the anſwer was returned, the <hi>Major</hi> was ſhot dead in the head with a fire-lock; The reſt of the Officers were aſhamed to <hi>Capitulate</hi> for an Accord, the <hi>Major</hi> having refuſed: immediately after, Captaine <hi>Duncan Forbeſſe</hi> was killed, and after him, Lievetenant <hi>Barbour,</hi> and then Captaine <hi>Carmichell,</hi> who had no charge there, but came by accident to viſit his <hi>Camerades</hi> before the Enemies coming, whoſe fortune was not to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew the payment of that debt by longer continuation. The Enemy then paſſing the Moate or Foſſey, with a generall ſtorme, ſcorned all quarters, and being entred, cruelly put all to the ſword, making no difference of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, age, nor ſex, but all alike cruelly put to death: ſo that five or ſix at moſt eſcaped, whereof <hi>Enſigne Lumſdell</hi> miraculouſly was one.</p>
               <p>The Enemy before this houſe was taken, as I was informed, loſt above a thouſand men, which made the Enemies crueltie the greater; and of our Regiment were killed above three hundred. And it is reported, that after the fury was paſt, they made inquiſition for the <hi>Majors</hi> body, and having found it, they ript up his breaſt, tooke out his heart, ſundered his gummes, and ſtucke his heart into his mouth; they alſo killed the Preacher, who being on his knees, begging life, was denied mercy.</p>

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:132555:30"/>breaking the peace of God, ſwimming in Chriſtian bloud, without mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to Officer, Souldier, or Preacher, heaping up wrath on their own ſoules, againſt the day of their appearance before that great <hi>Iudge,</hi> that ſhall judge both the quicke and the dead.</p>
               <p>Out of our enemies crueltie uſed here,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> we ought to learne to forbeare the like, leſt one day we might be uſed as they uſed our friends and Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: for we may be revenged on our enemies crueltie, repaying them in a Chriſtian manner, without making Beaſts of our ſelves; in not ſhewing mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy being ſought of us, which is to be more cruell than Lyons, who will not ſtirre thoſe who ſtoope unto them. And there is no greater token of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, than to doe that unto another, that we would not have done unto our ſelves. And would'ſt thou have mercy that refuſeſt to ſhew mercy, being ſought of thee? No truely; it is juſt with God, that he miſſe mercy, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth mercy unto others; and to have courage without mercy, is to bragge of vertue, and lacke the right uſe of it.</p>
               <p>Was there greater perfidie in the world than was uſed here at the in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of this houſe, willingly to harme the dead, and the innocent? For to wrong an innocent Preacher, was ſavage, beſeeming a beaſt, not a man; and to give a ſtabbe, as was done here, for the innocent ſmile of an Infant, was devilliſh blacke at the heart. We reade in the <hi>Turkiſh Story</hi> of a childe, that ſtrucke an intending murtherer into a ſwound with offering to embrace him. Would to God, all thoſe that refuſe mercy, were ſo ſtricken dead, to terrifie ſuch tyrants as they were! And I perſwade my ſelfe, none but villanous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, being Commanders ever ſuffered the like to have beene done without moderation: but, I hope, haughtie and violent minds will never bleſſe the owners; but that by Domineering they ſhall fall like Duft.</p>
               <p>This worthy <hi>Cavalier,</hi> of famous memory, after his death thus unchriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anly uſed, let no man judge by his end, that he in his life time uſed any man but generouſly: for I dare affirme, though ſometimes he was ſubject unto paſſion, it continued not long, he being of a good, ſweet, and milde nature, and very kinde and conſtant, where he profeſſed friendſhip, and as devout in the profeſſion of his Religion, profeſſed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as became a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian being ſincere.


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> And commonly his cuſtome was, leading Troopes on ſervice, till he came in Action, he went before them bare-headed, praying for a bleſſing to his actions, as he hath told me himſelfe; having asked a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for this his manner of carriage, he ſcorned in all his Onſets to have been any thing but a Leader, alwayes teaching by the ſtrongeſt authoritie, his owne forwardneſſe by his owne example: And as his humour ſcorned to be ſo baſe as to flatter, ſo he did hate to be ſo curriſh as to bite. But he was ever indued with inviolable Amitie, joyned with invaluable love; and as he was couragious, ſo he was conſtant; in the one, withſtanding his enemies, in the other, entertaining his friend. In a word, he was a reſolute Chriſtian, and a man truely honeſt; and therefore I perſwade my ſelfe, his death was but the beginning of his joy, and the end of his miſery: having therefore written nothing amiſſe of him, I neede deſire no pardon. But I know ſome men will object, as a blame in him, that he refuſed a <hi>Parlé,</hi> while as there was no appearance, either of reliefe, or holding out: to which, I cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe anſwer, than he anſwered himſelfe to ſome of the Officers that were moſt inward with him, which was, that he was ſorry the charge of the bloud of ſo many ſoules did lie on his ſhoulders. But if he ſhould give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:132555:30"/>that houſe, he was perſwaded, the King his Maſter would cauſe to hang him, ſeeing he had enemies about his Majeſtie, who would make him die, though innocent. Therefore he reſolved to die honourablie, rather than his name ſhould be brought in queſtion, and then to ſuffer at laſt. Here alſo we ſee a poore Miniſter in his laſt Act giving good example, not terrified with the horror of death, nor crueltie of his enemies, but on his knees being deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of mercy from man, begs mercy of <hi>God,</hi> dying as a Martyr, perſecuted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Death.</p>
               <p>A happie death to him, being reſolved with God and his Conſcience, to die innocently, like a valiant Souldier of Chriſt, incouraging others, even in the laſt Act of his Calling! A happie man, dying in ſinceritie, time ſhall not out-live his worth; he lives truely after death, whoſe pious Actions are his pillars of remembrance; for though his fleſh moulder to droſſe in the grave, yet his happineſſe is in a perpetuall growth, no day but addes ſome graines to his heape of glory.</p>

The <hi>Boore</hi> complaines to the Commiſſary, and the Commiſſary to me; to ſatisfie juſtice, we called a Councell of warres (having our Auditor with us) of the Regiment Officers; the buſineſſe exactly examined, according to his Majeſties Articles, the ſouldier was condemned to die, and to be ſhot at a poſt, to terrifie others by his example from the like hainous ſinne: The ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier getting time for that night to prepare himſelfe for death, the miniſter
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:132555:31"/>inſtructing him of his duety, the next morning the companies drawen to Armes, a Guard was directed to ſee the execution, the ſouldier couragiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Chriſtianly reſolved, being tied to a poſt was ſhot dead by his came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades, who without any delay executed the command laid on them by the malefactor, whoſe Corpes was preſently buried. The next day having ſhipt, we croſt over unto <hi>Lowland,</hi> where, according to his Majeſties orders, we were well quarteredand courteouſly received. The Colonells company and Sr. <hi>Patrick Mac-Geys</hi> with the ſtaffe, were quartered with me in <hi>Marbe,</hi> Captaine <hi>Mac-kenyee</hi> his company were quartered in <hi>Rubee,</hi> and Captaine <hi>Monro</hi> his company in <hi>Necoppine,</hi> where the Queene mother did remaine.</p>

               <p>this country is alſo plentifull of wood for building of ſhips, where his majeſty every yeare hath ſome builded by his owne maſter builder, a worthy gentleman begotten of <hi>scots</hi> anceſters, called mr. <hi>sinclaire,</hi> who ſpeakes the <hi>scottiſh</hi> tongue, and is very courteous to all his countrimen which come thither. the citizens alſo of this iland, being very rich, build ſhips for their owne uſe, and ſome they ſell unto ſtrangers.</p>

               <p>to returne then to my obſervation,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="N"/> I did ſee and learne here the truth of that proverbe in his Majeſties perſon, that the wiſe man only is the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningſt ſencer; no man can give a blow ſo ſoone, or ward and keepe himſelfe ſo ſafely as the wiſe man, and nothing is to be placed above him, but God,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:132555:31"/>the King of Kings and giver of wiſdome. To live is common, to be wiſe and good particular, and granted to a few: many I ſee wiſh for honour, for wealth, for friends, for fame, for pleaſure; I deſire but thoſe two; ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and wiſdome, which both I ſaw in this Magnanimous King, and in his country people following his Majeſties example. We finde not a man that the world ever had ſo plentifull in all things, as was <hi>Solomon:</hi> yet his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt was but one of theſe two, though indeed it includeth the other; for without vertue, wiſdome is not; or if it be, it undoes us at laſt: and to returne to my obſervation, in my judgement it may be ſaid of this Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous King, as was ſaid of <hi>Cæſar, Semi-Deus est:</hi> for as he is valiant,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="O"/> ſo he is learned, <hi>Ex utroque Rex,</hi> being valiant and wiſe, a Prince of an excellent ſpirit, capable of all good things, as I have ſeene, and obſerved in him: he is learned in the liberall ſciences, and underſtands well the Mathematicks and the practiſe of fortifications, as a ſouldier ſtudied in the Lawes, joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Armes with Iuſtice, two great helpes for the government of a Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dignity: he handles well his Armes, and is expert in riding of horſes, a ſtrong man for wreſtling, as all <hi>Europe</hi> affords, able for to give ſtrokes, and the levelleſt ſhooter with a peece, that ever I did ſee; for with a piſtoll he never miſſes a dogge in the head he ſhoots at; for experience in warfare, nothing inferiour to the greateſt Captaines we reade of, eaſie to come to, and very affable, patient to beare with heate, cold, hunger, and moſt dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in travell; and if I were to wiſh for the perſonage of a man, mine eyes did never ſee his like, for a ſtately majeſticke perſon, whom ever I will great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſpect and love for the good received, and ſhall be ever ready to ſerve him againſt all his enemies, my <hi>Gracious Soveraigne</hi> onely excepted, and his deereſt Siſters Royall Iſſue, to whom I have vowed my beſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
               <p>Here alſo in this Kingdome I did obſerve,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="P"/> that there is nothing mooves ſubjects more to obedience, then the opinion they conceive of their Princes care and diligence, in the conſervation of his Kingdome and ſubjects; and experience teacheth us, that the obedience due to Kings by their ſubjects is weake, if it be not grounded on feare and reſpective reverence. As authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is gotten by honourable and convenient carriage: ſo oftimes we ſee it is loſt by evill carriage. So that all greatneſſe deſtitute of vertue doth vaniſh in an inſtant; and therefore the Poets did ſay, that honour and reverence were the childrenbegotten of Majeſtie and authority: the example wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, we have in the perſon of <hi>Charles</hi> called the wiſe, who having ſeene <hi>France</hi> ruin'd by the former warres, under his predeceſſors <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Iohn, Normandie</hi> and <hi>Piccardie</hi> poſſeſſed by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and having <hi>Edward</hi> the third to deale with, the beſt and happieſt King ever <hi>England</hi> had, who defeated the <hi>French</hi> in two Battells. This Prince reſolved to keepe the reſt, finding it to be as good to governe by counſell as by force of Armes, he did nothing raſhly nor unfore-ſeene, but his deſigns were all well prem editated and dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, making choice of men wiſe, valiant, and knowing how to command in warres. <hi>Edward</hi> ſeeing his ſword thus blunted, and the courſe of his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories by the wiſdome of <hi>Charles</hi> interrupted, ſaid, who did ever ſee one out of his chamber to give a man ſo much adoe without Armes? Thus <hi>Charles</hi> was ſo wiſe, that his enemies did make no difficulty to praiſe him, for he not onely freed his people from miſery, but alſo gathered afterward a great treaſure for his ſonne, being called rich, as he was wiſe, and being
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:132555:32"/>reſpected of his ſubjects, and of his enemies, as this <hi>Magnanimous King of Denmark</hi> is, for his prudence after his warres, is as much to be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as his valour was in preſerving his ſubjects &amp; <hi>Throne</hi> from his enemies, being redacted to a corner; and his counſell ſerved alſo well, for the good of his ſubjects, the eſtate of his Throne, and for the recovery of his loſſes. And therefore <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaid, that counſell availed for the good of the State as well as Captaines, for it is oft ſeene in effect, that by the good advice of the one, the others have happily drawne, and governed their ſwords; And in another place he ſaith that <hi>Agamemnon</hi> Generall of <hi>Greece,</hi> did never wiſh for ten ſuch great Captaines as <hi>Ajax</hi> was, but rather ten wiſe counſellours, as <hi>Neſter</hi> was, which made <hi>Cicero</hi> ſo often to proclaime the honour due to eloquence above valour, ſaying, <hi>Cedant arma togæ, concedat laurea linguæ:</hi> but joyned together, as in this Magnanimous King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> they worke one to anothers hands, for the eſtabliſhment of his Throne, which I wiſh ſo long to continue as the world. Here alſo we may learne to eſchevv vice by the puniſhment inflicted upon this ſouldier for his exorbitancy, in having raviſh'd a virgin of her honour, he was bereft himſelfe of life, by Gods juſtice, puniſhing man for ſinne examplary to others.</p>
               <p>Againſt this ſinne of raviſhing Emperours ordained puniſhment,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Q"/> to wit, to loſe their heads, and their goods alſo to be confiſcate, but the law of the <hi>Canoniſts</hi> treates more meekely with raviſhers, ſuffering them to marry thoſe whom they raviſhed: But the Lord judgeing more ſeverely, ſteeping his rods in viniger, ordaines ſtricter puniſhment for ſuch malefactors. To eſchew therefore the committing of ſuch villanies, I will here ſet downe ſome remedies to hinder man from ſuch vices, that we may eſchew the like puniſhment.


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="R"/> The firſt remedy then is to abſtaine from the exceſſe of wine and meates, not to be drunke with wine, wherein there is diſſolution. The ſecond remedy is to eſchew idleneſſe and too much ſleeping, which is ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to travell and diligence. The third, to eſchew the company of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane perſons, whoſe delight is in filthy communications, for he that will touch pitch, muſt be defiled with it. <hi>Evill ſpeeches corrupt good manners;</hi> and with Wolves we learne to howle and cry. <hi>Dina</hi> the daughter of <hi>Iacob</hi> deſiring to ſee what was not convenient, neither for her ſhamefac'tneſſe, nor for the reſpect ſhe ought to have carried to her fathers houſe, was raviſhed, violated, and was the cauſe of greater evill. The fourth remedy is to keepe both women and maides in a convenient modeſty of a chaſt behaviour, without which there is a doore opened to all villany and filthineſſe, which is able of vertue to make vice. The other remedies are, to live ſoberly and vertuouſly in ourcallings, eſchewing evill company and filthy communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, loving rather to take paines in our callings, remembring our duty we owe to God, in not delighting in any uncleanneſſe, that we may eſchew the malediction hanging over the heads of thoſe, which continue in their filthineſſe without repentance, abuſing the long ſuffering and patience of the Lord our God and Father.</p>
               <p>To conclude this obſervation, there are lawes and juſtice obſerved as well among ſouldiers,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="S"/> as in other governments, and the ſtricteſt juſtice that is, with leaſt partiality: our lawes are the Kings Articles, we are ſworne to obey our Preſident or Iudge, he amongſt us preſent having the command, to whom his Majeſty joynes, as aſſeſſor to the Iudge, an Auditor for doing of juſtice, our Aſſiſers or Iury we have not to ſeeke <hi>(viz.)</hi> a competent

Other ſlight puniſhments we enjoyne for ſlight faults, put in execution by their Camerades; as the <hi>Loupegarthe,</hi> when a Souldier is ſtripped naked above the waſte, and is made to runne a furlong betwixt two hundred Souldiers, ranged alike oppoſite to others, leaving a ſpace in the midſt for the Souldier to runne through, where his Camerades whip him with ſmall rods, ordained and cut for the purpoſe by the <hi>Gavilliger,</hi> and all to keepe good order and diſcipline; for other leſſer faults, there is ordained ſlighter puniſhments, as Irons, ſtanding at a poaſt, his hands bound up above his head; likewiſe ſitting on a Treen or woodden Mare, in ſome publicke place, to make him aſhamed of his fault: As alſo ſometimes to ſtand fix or ſeaven houres longer than ordinary at the centrie poſture; as I was once made to ſtand in my younger yeares at the <hi>Louver gate</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> being then in the Kings Regiment of the Guards, paſſing my prenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, for ſleeping in the morning, when I ought to have beene at my excer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, for puniſhment I was made ſtand from eleven before noone, to eight of the Clocke in the night Centry, Armed with Corſlet, Head-piece, Brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, being Iron to the teeth, in a hot Summers day, till I was weary of my life, which ever after made me the more ſtrict in puniſhing thoſe under my Command.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="T"/> we were moſt in danger when we wanted buſineſſe, for while we want buſineſſe, and have no foe to awe us, we are readie to drowne in the mudde of vice and ſloathfulneſſe. So our Regiment having laine ſix moneths in idleneſſe and ſloath, eating and drinking, and ſometimes doing worſe, for lacke of employment in our Callings, falling out amongſt our ſelves unneceſſarily, and without reaſon abuſing both Burgers and Boores, ſo that when we lacked employment, then was the <hi>Gavilliger</hi> and his Irons beſt employed, inſolency domineering, ſo that when we came
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:132555:33"/>to endure hunger, thirſt, and cold on our ſhippes, we were growne ſo effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, that we could not ſleepe without a good bed, our ſtomackes could not digeſt a Gammon of Bacon, or cold Beefe without muſtard, ſo farre we were out of uſe, till this <hi>Magnanimous</hi> King came to lead us, who in a ſhort time, without the helpe of Phyſicke, cured our cloyd ſtomackes, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned our effeminate ſides, in ſtead of a warme Chamber, made us contented with a hole digged in the ground, to let the winde and Bullets flee over us, making hunger our beſt ſauce, giving us employment, and to our <hi>Gavilliger</hi> reſt and eaſe at home.</p>
               <p>O how bright then doth the ſoule of man grow with uſe and Negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on! Now could our Souldiers having made a little bootie on this Iſland, ſpeake like <hi>Cleanthes,</hi> when he had laboured and gotten ſome Coyne, he ſhewes it his Companions, that he then could nouriſh another <hi>Cleanthes</hi>: even ſo our Souldiers ſhewing and telling their <hi>Camerades</hi> of their bootie, they rejoyced the hearts of their Leaders, whom before they had offended by their exorbitancy in their idleneſſe, bringing joy with profit, when they were exerciſed in their Callings, baniſhing miſchiefe from themſelves by their diligence: for it is one of our greateſt happineſſe in our Calling, to have a minde and love to vertuous exerciſes, raiſing us daily to bleſſedneſſe and contentation; for every one ſhall ſmell of that he is buſied in, and every no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Action addes ſinewes to the vertuous minde: where on the contrary, ſurely he muſt be miſerable, that loves not to be diligent in his Calling, when he ought to employ himſelfe; for if he growes no better, yet ſure it keeps him from doing worſe, not having time by his idleneſſe to entertaine the Devill. When our enemies leaſt looked for us, then came we with <hi>Bello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> ſummoning him to the Combate, but he obeyes not, and for his cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize we degrade him of his Armes, and baniſh him to ſome other corner to lurke in, ſeeing he lacked the courage to have made us ſport at our landing, or to have given us an <hi>Alarum</hi> in our Quarters; to have once tryed what for Souldiers we were, or what reſolution or conduct we had: for he ought to have buſied us at our landing, as well with the ſpade and the ſhovell, as with the Pike and the Musket, and ſo we could have ſaid, we had an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, as we had not, but a flying daſtard or coward.</p>
               <p>This Fort was ſcurvily given over, which any reſolute Commander could well have kept for three dayes, during which time, he had added to his owne reputation, and ſubſtracted doubtleſſe from ours, by diminiſhing of our number, which at laſt would have made him get better Conditions of Quarters, and a more honourable Accord: for in ſuch a caſe, I would chooſe before I came in my enemies Reverence without Armes, rather to fight to the laſt man, and if I chanced to be the laſt, I had rather die, being reſolved, with reſolution having Armes in my hands, than unawares, being unprepared, to be knockt downe miſerably, when I looked not for Death.</p>
               <p>Here I did ſee the <hi>Ingenier</hi> that built this Fort (who in time of working did oftentimes beate the Boores to make them worke) for his crueltie he was moſt cruelly beaten againe, and he running to his Majeſties feete for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge (thinking thereby to eſcape) was on his knees crying for mercy, ſo hard purſued by the multitude, that before his Majeſtie he was cruelly bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten dead, as the reward of his former tyranny, and ſo would God.</p>
               <p>Here alſo we ſee, that oftentimes the Innocent doth ſuffer with the Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as hapned to that worthy <hi>Cavalier</hi> the Count of <hi>Mongomrie,</hi> being cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly

               <p>Happy therefore are thoſe who can eſchew evill by the example of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Here alſo we ſee, that the beſt meanes to ſuppreſſe the inſolency of the tumultuous multitude, is a band of well commanded ſouldiers with Armes, who are ever good ſervants, but more often cruell Maſters. It is then the duety of a Generall in ſuch caſes, peremptorily to ſee that his accord be kept, which otherwiſe being broken cauſeth much evill and miſchiefe to follow. His Majeſty as he was diligent in the intaking of this Iland, ſo we ſee him carefull of the keeping of it, as his conqueſt, by leaving a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor with a Garriſon in it, to be his retreate, in caſe of neede, out of <hi>Holſten.</hi> We reade that <hi>Guiſhcardin</hi> in his hiſtory of the warres of <hi>Italy</hi> in his firſt booke, accuſes under hand the <hi>French,</hi> that did enlarge their territories by Armes, and did not maintaine and keepe their conqueſts, but on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry did ruine themſelves in the end.</p>
               <p>The Emperour <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> having read the great conqueſt of <hi>Alexander</hi> in the Eaſt, he did wonder that <hi>Alexander</hi> did not take care to keepe them, as he travelled to winne them. It is ſaid of <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> King of <hi>Albany,</hi> that where he once ſet his foote, he was conquerour there. But was ever unfortunate in keeping his conqueſt; and therefore the King <hi>Antigonus</hi> compared him to a gameſter at dice, that loſt his owne in hope of gaine.

And <hi>Baleus</hi> writing the lives of the Popes, writes of Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the twenty third being asked what thing was fartheſt from truth, he anſwered, it was the vulgar opinion, for all things they praiſe merite blame, what they thinke is but vanity; what they ſay is but lies; they condemne the good, and approve the evill, and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:132555:34"/>magnifie but infamy: And <hi>Nicholas Hanap</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> in his booke of the unconſtancy of the people, hath a whole chapter apart to this purpoſe, and <hi>Arrianus</hi> in his firſt booke praiſeth much the wiſdome of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great; in taking away from the people of <hi>Epheſus</hi> the meanes to mutine againſt the chiefe men of the Towne: for ſome of the mutiners being executed <hi>Alexander</hi> forbids to ſearch, or puniſh the reſt, knowing that if once the popular could looſe the raine, there was nothing to follow but miſchiefe, where the innocent might ſuffer as well as the guilty, as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe here the Count of <hi>Mongomry,</hi> that ranne the hazard of death, being long bedred after his beating, without ſenſe or feeling. And <hi>Thucydide</hi> did in his third booke, ſpeaking of thoſe of the Iſle of <hi>Corſu,</hi> did feele the evill of a ſturdy popular having licence to doe evill, how much it was to be doubted, in ſo much that the Maſſacre being ſo cruell, that there was no villany left unpractiſed, and ſuch ſtrange things he writes of, that the Fathers did ſuffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate their owne children, and thoſe that were runne to the Churches for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, were cruelly put to death; who pleaſes may reade the ſtory, where it is ſet downe more at large.

               <p>To conclude then this point,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Y"/> it is a vaine thing to be a follower of the popular ſort: for none is the better for their praiſe, nor the worſe for their blame. And therefore <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſaid well, that one man could not be maſter and ſervant of the people, otherwiſe, perforce it behooveth him to fall into inconveniencie; as we reade in the fable written of the ſerpent, the taile whereof came one day to quarrell the head, ſaying, he would goe his day about foremoſt, and not goe alwayes behinde, which being granted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him by the head, he found it worſt himſelfe, not knowing how or where to goe, and became the cauſe that the head was all ſpoyl'd and rent, being compelled againſt nature to follow a part without ſight or hearing to leade it.

               <p>Our hap here and good-ſucceſſe in making of bootie was ſoone reſtrained: no man, no beaſt, no creature, but hath ſome thing to ballaſt their lightneſſe. One ſcale is not alwayes in depreſſion, nor the other lifted ever high, but by the Beame is ever kept in motion; nothing but hath ſome thing to awe it: man with man is awed and defended, the world is but a perpetuall warre, and a wedding.

               <p>Here I muſt not forget the memory of our Preacher Maſter <hi>William For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſſe,</hi> a Preacher for Souldiers, yea and a Captaine in neede, to lead Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers on a good occaſion, being full of courage, with diſcretion and good Conduct, beyond ſome Captaines I have knowne, that were not ſo capable as he: at this time he not onely prayed for us, but went on with us, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke, as I thinke, mens carriage, and having found a Sergeant neglecting his dutie, and his honour at ſuch a time (whoſe name I will not expreſſe) having chidden him, did promiſe to reveale him unto me, as he did after their ſervice, the Sergeant being called before me, and accuſed, did deny his accuſation, alleaging if he were no Paſtour that had alleaged it, he would not lie under the injury; the Preacher offered to fight with him, that it was truth he had ſpoken of him; whereupon I caſhier'd the Sergeant, and gave his place to a worthier, called <hi>Mongo Gray,</hi> a Gentleman of good worth, and of much courage. The Sergeant being caſhier'd, never call'd Maſter <hi>William</hi> to account, for which he was evill thought of, ſo that he retired home and quit the warres.</p>
               <p>Some men perhaps will blame our Conduct here, for purſuing men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to a Church, being a place of refuge.

               <p>Secondly; They having baniſhed the Goſpell, and the Preachers of it out of the Church, we had good reaſon to baniſh them, who had made of the houſe of <hi>God</hi> a <hi>Denne</hi> of theeves and murtherers, as they were at <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denberg,</hi> having killed our <hi>Camerades,</hi> and <hi>maſſacred</hi> our <hi>Preacher,</hi> being on his knees begging mercy, and could finde none.</p>
               <p>Thirdly; They treacherouſly retired themſelves to a Loft apart in the Church, for their owne ſafeties, and left traines of Powder to blow us up
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:132555:36"/>at our entry, which made our Compaſſion towards them the colder; for when the ſubject of our hatred is ſinne, it cannot be too deepe; and for my owne part, I refuſed not to ſhew compaſſion on thoſe, who did beg it of me, and what others did in their fury, I did tolerate, not being powerfull to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them: yet truly my compaſſion was ſo much, that when I ſaw the houſe ordained for <hi>Gods</hi> ſervice defiled with their bloud and ours, and the pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church covered over with the dead bodies of men, truely my heart was moved unto the milde ſtreames of pittie, and wept, as is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of <hi>Cæſar,</hi> when he heard how <hi>Pompey</hi> died.

               <p>IN time of this hot ſervice, no man could perceive any alteration in the majeſtie of this King his Royall face, but rather ſeemed notwithſtanding of his loſſe, as it were, triumphing over his enemies, and comforting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> moſt graciouſly ſaid. We ought not to be aſtoniſhed, when things happen unto us beyond our expectation: and that which was more eſteemed as a <hi>God</hi> amongſt the <hi>Pagans,</hi> was extraordinarily changeable, ſometimes taking part with one, and ſometimes with another. In a word, this <hi>Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous King</hi> did abate nothing of his former courage, or of his gravitie: So that his very enemies, if they had ſeene him at ſo neere a diſtance as I did, they could not but have humbly reverenced his <hi>Majeſtie</hi> for his magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficke ſtature, higher than any ordinary man by the head: yet aſhamed he was, to ſtoope for a Cannon Bullet, when they flew thickeſt.</p>
               <p>And for the accompliſhment of his vertues, Nature hath given him an extraordinary rich Preſence, to wit, a face as manly as poſſible may be ſeene, worthy of a great King, well mixt in complexion, his eyes flaming and ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, full of courage, his beard browne, his noſe A quiline, or Emperiall, his voice manly, winning the hearts of thoſe that ſee or heare him; in effect,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:132555:37"/>
                  <hi>A Royall King, full of aſſurance,</hi> without any feare at all, in reſpect of man: yet full of Majeſtie, amiable to his friends, and terrible to his enemies.</p>
               <p>Here then we may ſee, that it is the LORD that Guards and keepes <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> from imminent dangers that environ them, whereof Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries both ancient and moderne, are full of examples of the miraculous delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of great perſonages from dangers.</p>
               <p>One notable Story I will bring to confirme this divine protection, in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Titus</hi> ſonne to <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> appointed for the ruining of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due and puniſh the <hi>Iewes. Flavius Ioſeph</hi> in his ſixt booke and ſecond Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Warres of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> records of him, that before the ſiege was layd to the Towne, of minde to recognize, he fell unawares amongſt an <hi>Ambuſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade</hi> of his enemies, where then it was knowne, as much as ever, that it is the LORD who diſpoſeth of the moments of warre, and of the life of <hi>Kings:</hi> for though <hi>Titus</hi> had no head-piece nor Corſlet on his backe (having not gone to fight, but to recognize) of an infinite number of ſhot, ſhot at him, none touched him, though many were ſhot behind him thoſe darts ſhot aſide at him, he rebated them with his ſword, and thoſe ſhot low, he made his horſe skip to eſchew them. The <hi>Iewes</hi> perceiving his reſolution, made great noiſe, exhorting one another to runne at him, and to follow him where ever he went. A rare example of a rare deliverance, where we ſee that he is well guarded, whom the <hi>Lord</hi> keepes. Here alſo we may ſee, what difference there is betwixt Commanders, he in <hi>Feamer</hi> ſhewed himſelfe no Souldier; neither yet the Captaine in <hi>Aickleford:</hi> but this brave follow that comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in <hi>Keele,</hi> preſerved himſelfe and others, and that with credit; where we ſee, that where wiſedome and valour doe meer, oft-times the ſucceſſe is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable; and a mans diſcretion is ſeene when he abides a fit occaſion, as this brave fellow did: where I ſinde alwayes, that thoſe are the beſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, that are reſolute and remiſſe, not hunting before he ſees his prey, and then with advantage, if he would catch,</p>
               <p>Here alſo, experience deare bought did teach us,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that it is better in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding men on exployts, to command them proportionally out of divers Regiments, than to command them all out of one, which were to undoe a Regiment: and we ſee often, that the examples of the noble carriage of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, doe much animate and encourage their followers to well-doing; and it is a comely thing for the ſervant of the publique, to teach by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which makes his fame live after death, as this worthy <hi>Engliſh Cavalier</hi> did, eſpecially being in the publique view of the King his Maſter, his Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades, and his enemies, carrying their Characters from ſervice, as the marks of his valour, without fainting, though wounded to death.</p>
               <p>Here alſo our <hi>Scottiſh</hi> High-land-men are prayſe-worthy, who for lacke of Boats, made uſe of their vertue and courage in ſwimming the Seas, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding of their wounds, with their cloathes, ſhewing their Maſters, they were not the firſt came off, but with the laſt; following the example of their Leader, they would not ſtay to be Priſoners, as many doe at ſuch times, and never returne.</p>
               <p>I did alſo obſerve after this dayes ſervice, an alteration in the common Souldiers behaviour, while as before we were to ſend out a partie of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded men, we were troubled with the Souldiers, ſtriving who ſhould goe out on the partie, every one deſiring it ſhould be he, but after this dayes ſmart once felt by their Camerades, they learned to be more wiſe, and to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:132555:38"/>ſtay till they were commanded, and then they obeyed, though not ſo freely as before.</p>
               <p>Here alſo I will entreat thee, Iudicious Reader, to give me leave to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe ſomewhat, to diſcourſe a little of Sea-fights, which occurred in the diſcharge of the laſt dutie, though not properly belonging to my ſcope. Yet in this retreat-making, as we were in danger of killing, ſo were we in danger of drowning, by the enemies Cannon piercing our ſhippes, repaying us for the hurt done by our Shippes and Cannon to their Towne and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, having in one houre diſcharged amongſt them an infinite number of ſhot.</p>
               <p>To give then notice to the Reader of his Majeſties power by Sea, I will relate a Story of a Sea-fight, that happened betwixt the <hi>Swedens</hi> and the <hi>Danes,</hi> which was in the yeare 1564. the thirtieth of <hi>May:</hi> the Story is written by <hi>Gaſperence</hi> in his Commentaries of the <hi>Swedens</hi> warres, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
               <p>Amongſt other ſhippes, ſaith he, there was one which in greatneſſe and excellent equipage, went beyond all humane apprehenſion, ſo that many affirmed,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that fince the memory of man, the like of her was not ſeene on the North Ocean, which by the <hi>Swedens,</hi> in their language, was called <hi>Make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Matchleſſe,</hi> carrying two hundred pieces of Ordnance. The <hi>Swedes</hi> Admirall, truſting much in this ſhippe, did employ his whole force againſt the principall <hi>Dane</hi> ſhippe, called the <hi>Fortune,</hi> furiouſly cannonading her, till he had ſhot her fourteene times under water, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove one hundred times above water, on her Maſts and Shrowdes: the Conflict of the firſt day being doubtfull, both the Armies being much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered, the next day the <hi>Danes</hi> being ſure of one ſide, next the land, and on the other ſide, having the <hi>Swedens</hi> Fleere, that preſſed to make them ground, but the winde turned ſo, that the <hi>Danes</hi> having the winde at beſt, they chaſed the <hi>Swedens</hi> Fleete, ſcattering them ſo, that the Matchleſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almoſt overthrowne by the ſtrength of the <hi>Danes</hi> Fleete, was driven on a banke of ſand, where ſhe was burnt by the <hi>Danes</hi> with wilde fire, which the <hi>Danes</hi> launcht within her; the Admirall of the <hi>Swedens,</hi> called <hi>Iacques Bagg,</hi> and <hi>Arrold Troll,</hi> Councellour of the Kingdome, and a Lord called <hi>Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher Ander,</hi> were taken priſoners.

               <p>The Rogues, the Commiſſaries did much differ in their love to their King and Country, from that worthy gentleman of famous memory, we reade of in our owne Stories, called <hi>William Seaton,</hi> who is worthily recorded of, for his love to the publique, preferring it to his owne children, who being Governour of <hi>Barwicke,</hi> he and his wife did chooſe rather to quit their owne lives, and the lives of their children, then to give over the place un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> chooſing rather to keepe it, for the weale of the publique, and for the honour of their King and Country: preferring the publique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale, to their owne particular: the ſtory I neede not amplify, being well knowne. This Magnanimous King, ſcorning the attempts of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ceaſeth not ſtill to hazard his owne perſon and Crowne for the ſafety of his people: for he truſted and confided ſo much in God, that he knew well the Scepter was ordained for thoſe that ſlighted it, and not for thoſe did cover it greedily, as his enemies did.</p>
               <p>Here alſo we ſee that the enemies forces being drawne towards <hi>Traile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound,</hi> minding that way to come unto <hi>Denmark,</hi> his Majeſty was diverted from his reſolution, and was forced to joyne with <hi>Traileſound</hi> to make a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive warre, for the ſafety of his Country and people, for if the enemy had gotten <hi>Traileſound,</hi> he had an eaſie way to come into <hi>Denmark,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there were no great ſtrengths, and getting ſhipping, Artillary and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, (whhereof his Majeſty was well provided) he had then the paſſe open unto <hi>Britaine,</hi> when he pleaſed. But he was wiſely prevented by his Majeſty and his Councell, God bringing things to paſſe according to his ſecret decree, and not according to the will of man.</p>
               <p>Here alſo we ſee, that it is the duty of a Generall lying neere an enemy, to know all avenues well, and betimes to beſet them well with diligence, and good watches; for if this paſſe at <hi>Gottenbrode</hi> had not beene timely well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, his Majeſty might have fallen into the enemies hands, the paſſage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cut off betwixt his Majeſty and the ſhips.</p>
               <p>Alſo in all extremities, it is the duty of Commanders to encourage their inferiours, otherwiſe the paſſengers may be affraid, if the Skipper or ſteerſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man gives over: as Commanders do looke to their owne credits, ſo they ought to be carefull of their followers ſaferies.</p>

               <p>In this accident,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> which hapned in <hi>Zeland</hi> betwixt the Boores and our Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, we may ſee the Antipathy that is betwixt Souldiers and Boores, where the one cannot with patience indure the ſight of the other, without ſome preſent jarre, ſo that it were impoſſible to make them agree together, if <hi>Military Diſcipline</hi> were not ſtrictly obſerved, and the tranſgreſſours ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplarily puniſhed.</p>

               <p>No menagrie in my opinion comparable to that which ſpares the lives of men from loſing, and I perſwade my ſelfe,

               <p>Here alſo I did obſerve, that frequent danger doth encourage the feebleſt Souldier, who by daily dangers, and the familiaritie made with death, in ſtepping every day over the bodies of dead men, who perhaps never before had ſeene one die naturally, much leſſe to ſee daily and hourely examples of violent death, learning wit, by by-paſt loſſes, and experience had in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of our Calling, being hardned with toyle and travell. Therefore, in my judgement, no man is more worthy of the name of a Souldier, than he that indures beſt weariſome toyle and travell in this honourable Calling, not withdrawing the ſhoulder, but by puſhing it forwards couragiouſly, having once begun: for though in all affaires of this kinde, the beginnings ſeeme hard and difficult, yet ſoone after we finde it lighter, according to the meaſure of our advancement, and reward in the end, we enjoy ſtill the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contentment, as became of me the firſt time my friends led me up a ſteepe hill, when my breath begun to faile me, looking behinde, and ſeeing what way I had put by, the reſt to the top of the hill ſeemed nothing unto me, being ſo neare the end of my travell, but was pleaſant rather than te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious. And therefore we uſe to ſay, He that beginneth well hath halfe ended.</p>
               <p>At our entry in this Towne, our travell and toyle once begun, continued night and day for ſix weekes, till we grew hard with travell, yet not hard, as many of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> that are hard againſt the Musket Bullet, this proofe we lacked.

               <head>The ſixteenth Dutie diſcharged of our Watches and Accidents, that occurred in this Towne, before the Enemy did ſtorme our Workes.</head>
               <p>THE twenty-eight of <hi>May</hi> 1628, not without danger both by water and from land, we entred the Towne of <hi>Traileſound,</hi> the Emperiall Armie lying before it, having their batteries neere the water; at our in-coming they ſhot our Maſt, having grounded before our in-coming, we ranne the hazard both of drowning and killing; but being againe without hurt come off, our Camerades wearied of watching, immediatly after our entry we relieved the watch at <hi>Franckendor,</hi> being the onely Poaſt in the Towne moſt purſued by the enemy.</p>
               <p>The order of our watch was after this manner:


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> of the ſeaven Companies one Company watched ſtill on the Iſland before the Towne, called the <hi>Hollomne;</hi> the other three Companies were ordained by foure a clocke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoone, to parade in the Market place, and afterwards to march to their Poaſt at <hi>Franckendor,</hi> without the walles on ſcurvie outworkes, which were but ſlightly fortified with a dry Moate, the enemy lying ſtrong before us, and approaching neare, we fearing a ſudden on-fall, thoſe that were relieved of the watch by five of the clocke, were ordained againe to meet by nine of the clocke at night, and to watch againe on the by-watch, till foure of the clocke in the morning, whereof the one halfe were appointed to he in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe at their Armes without the Port neere the workes, while as the other halfe were appointed alſo to lie in readineſſe at their Armes on the Market place, to attend all occaſions of Alarums, either within or without the Towne: and thus we watched nightly, relieving one another, for the ſpace of ſix weekes.</p>
               <p>The reſt of the Poſtes, above the walles, were alſo beſet by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> but none had the halfe of our duties to diſcharge, by reaſon the whole ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches were made by the Enemy to us, as being the weakeſt part. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding of this our great nightly watch and dutie kept, the Burgers of the Citie did prove very ungratefull and unthankfull to us, in not quartring our Souldiers, as they ought to doe: for Captaine <hi>Monro</hi> his Company did lie on the ſtreets foure nights unquartred, till the fortnight that they came off the watch, unknowne to their Officers, they went to the Burgo-maſter his owne houſe, and ſaid, they would quarter with him, if there were not orders taken for their quartring, but receiving a ſoft anſwer, they retired for that night: in the meane time, the Burgo-maſter did complaine to Colonell <hi>Holke,</hi> then Governour, who did cauſe to aſſemble a Councell of warre, where the Lievetenant and Company were both accuſed, as mutiners; the Lievetenant proving he knew nothing of it, and that the Souldiers had done it without his knowledge, he was aſſoyled and made free by the ſentence of the Councell of warre: But the Company were ordained, being divided in three Corporalſhips, that out of every Corporalſhip one ſhould be hang'd, who were to draw Billets out of a Hatt, which were all blankes, till one had the Gallowes on it.</p>
               <p>The order and ſentence of the Councell of warre being duly obeyed, three were led aſide, and committed to priſon, to be reſolved againſt the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:132555:42"/>and the reſt were remitted to their Quarters, of the three ordained to be executed, it was concluded againe, by the interceſſion of the Officers made to the Governour, that one might ſuffer, who againe being two <hi>Scots</hi> and a <hi>Dane,</hi> having drawne lots, it fell to the <hi>Dane</hi> to be hang'd, the Governour himſelfe being a <hi>Dane</hi> alſo, he could not of his credit fruſtrate ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, ſeeing before he was ſo earneſt to ſee our Nation puniſhed for a fault, whereof he was rather guilty himſelfe, not having appointed them quarters as he ought, ſo that the <hi>Dane</hi> ſuffred juſtly for a <hi>Danes</hi> fault.</p>
               <p>The Captaines of ſome Companies being abſent in <hi>Scotland,</hi> having gone for recruets, the duety being great, Lievetenant <hi>Saunders Hay</hi> was made Captaine to <hi>Annan</hi> his company, being informed the Captaine was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in <hi>Scotland:</hi> Enſigne <hi>Gordon</hi> being made Lievetenant to Sr. <hi>Patrick Mac-Gey,</hi> being long ſicke in <hi>Lowland,</hi> and having a little recovered, on his journey to <hi>Traileſound,</hi> at <hi>Copmanhaggen</hi> in <hi>Denmark,</hi> died ſuddainely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a reſolute brave young Cavalier, and of good parts, was much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.</p>
               <p>He being dead Enſigne <hi>Gawin Allen</hi> was made Lievetenant, and <hi>Patrick Dumbarre,</hi> a young gentleman, of worth and merit, was advanced to be Enſigne.</p>
               <p>During our reſidence here, our orders were ſo ſtrict, that neither Officer, nor ſouldier was ſuffered to come off his watch, neither to dine or ſuppe, but their meate was carried unto them, to their poſte. The enemy approaching hard, and we working faſt, for our owne ſafeties, where ſometimes, we ſaly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, and did viſit the enemy, in his Trenches, but little to their content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; till at laſt, the enemy did approach right under our worke, where ſometimes, being ſo neere, we begun to jeere one another, ſo that the <hi>Dutch</hi> one morning taunting us, ſaid, they did heare, there was a ſhip come from <hi>Denmarke</hi> to us, laden with Tobacco and Pipes,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> one of our ſouldiers ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them over the worke, a Morgan ſterne, made of a large ſtocke banded with Iron like the ſhaft of a halbert, with a round Globe at the end with croſſe Iron pikes, ſaith, here is one of the Tobacco pipes, wherewith we will beate out your braines, when ye intend to ſtorme us.</p>
               <p>We did alſo nightly take ſome priſoners of them, ſometimes ſtealing off their centeries, which made many Alarums in the night, and in the day time. Here a man might ſoone learne to exerciſe his Armes, and put his courage in practiſe: and to give our Lievetenant Colonell his due, he had good orders, and he did keepe both Officers and ſouldiers under good diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and he knew well how to make others underſtand themſelves, from the higheſt to the loweſt.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> coming forth in his holy-dayes-clothes, to take the ayre, went never home againe, till he was carried quicke or dead, where ſome had their heads ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated from their bodies, by the Cannon; as happened to one Lievete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and thirteene Souldiers, that had their foureteene heads ſhot from them

               <p>It is ſaid, that valour is then beſt temper'd, when it can turne out of ſterne fortitude, unto the mild ſtreames of pitty: who could behold theſe acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and not be moved with pitty and compaſſion? and who will not weepe at the caſuall miſeries our calling is ſubject unto, in following oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the leading of an ambitious Generall, yea and of an ambitious Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, yea the following of an ambitious Souldier, delighting ſometimes to treade over his enemies, as happened many times unto us during this ſiege?</p>
               <p>Who then is more compaſſionate, in peace or warre, then the martiall man? Obſerve generally, and you ſhall finde, that the moſt famous men have both courage and compaſſion; of which in this City we had neede; of courage againſt our enemies, and of compaſſion to our friends, Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades, and ſometimes to our enemies.</p>
               <p>You ſee here we were made to keepe double watch, as wiſe men ought to do: for when we kept ſteddy watches, the enemy could not harme us much, being wary of our ſelves, and he that can do this, he ſurely merits the name of a good Souldier, but oftimes, we are our owne worſt enemies, and killing our ſelves we neede no other enemy againſt us. Therefore at ſuch a Siege as this was, ſobriety and temperance were requiſite to a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, as well as valour to defend him from his enemies.</p>
               <p>Here our enemies were our pedagogues teaching us vertue, every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment minding us of our duety to God and man: yea minding us both of Death, and of Iudgement: here we needed no dead mans pawe before us, to minde us of Death, when Death it ſelfe never went night or day with his horror from our eyes, ſparing none, making no difference of perſons, or quality, but <hi>aquo pede,</hi> treading alike on all came in his way, whoſe houre was come.</p>
               <p>Here I wiſh not the gentle reader to miſtake this inſurrection of <hi>Monre</hi> his company for a mutiny. It was not; neither againſt their Officers, nor yet in prejudice of their Maſters ſervice. Therefore I would rather terme it, a rude ignorance in ſeeking their due, though unformally, whereof their Officers had no part, and therefore were made free by a Councell of warres, but the unthankefulneſſe of the Citizens (in ſparing their meanes from fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of thoſe that kept them,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> their wives and children, from the furious rage of their enemies, at ſuch time as they themſelves did looke for no ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, till they came for to relieve them) cannot be well excuſed, but their unthankefulneſſe was ſo much the greater, that they err'd againſt the very lawes of hoſpitality, being in their unthankefulneſſe farre inferiour to Beaſts. For we reade, that the <hi>Athenians</hi> did bring thoſe guilty of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefulneſſe before the Iuſtice, to be puniſhed, and that juſtly; becauſe he that forgets a benefit received, without making any ſatisfaction, doth take away humane ſociety, without which the world could not ſubfiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:132555:43"/>ſuch fellowes ſome of them were made ſlaves, being not worthy the name of free Citizens: and the Canon lawe makes the ungratefull the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable of all men; And therefore they were cruelly puniſhed.</p>
               <p>To make then the ingratitude of the Citizens of <hi>Traileſound</hi> towards Souldiers the more odious, I will inferre the Stories of Beaſts here to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them; <hi>Elian</hi> writes of a <hi>Dragon</hi> mindfull of the good done to him (as theſe Rogues were not) in theſe termes, in his thirteenth booke. In <hi>Achaia</hi> there was a Towne called <hi>Petra,</hi> where a young boy did buy a <hi>Dragon</hi> very little, feeding it diligently, making of it, playing with it, and making it ly in his Bed, till it became great, and a <hi>Dragon</hi> in effect: thoſe of the place fearing ſome evill by it, did cauſe it to be carried unto a deſert: the boy becoming a man alſo, and certaine yeares after, returning from a feaſt, with ſome of his Camerads, they met with Robbers, and crying out for helpe, there comes the <hi>Dragon</hi> running on the Robbers, killing ſome, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the reſt to flight, ſaves the life of him that had done him good. A memorable acknowledgment to convince thoſe of <hi>Traileſound.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may joyne to this ſtory, the memory of the <hi>Lion</hi> healed by <hi>Androt</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> ſlave, whoſe life afterwards the <hi>Lyon</hi> ſaved. The ſtory is written by <hi>Gellius</hi> and <hi>Elian,</hi> and alſo now ſet out in verſe by <hi>Dubartas,</hi> in the ſixt day of the firſt weeke.</p>
               <p>Here alſo we may ſee the profit and benifit good order doth bring uno the obſervers of it: though we thought hard, not to be ſuffered to come off our Poſtes for our ordinary recreation, nor yet to ſleepe from our Poſtes, we found at laſt the benefit redounded unto our ſelves: for while as the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my purſued us hard, we were at hand to defend our ſelves, and to maintaine our credits; otherwiſe, it had become of us, as it became in the <hi>Swedens</hi> wars in <hi>Germany</hi> of <hi>Magdeburg</hi> on the <hi>Elve,</hi> and of <hi>Franckeford</hi> on the <hi>Oder,</hi> being both loſt through negligence and careleſſe watch, which made much inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent bloud to have bin ſhed in both.

               <p>THE Emperour <hi>Alexander Severe</hi> had reaſon to ſay, that Military Diſcipline did conſerve and maintaine the Eſtate: And ſo might the magnanimous King of <hi>Denmarke</hi> ſay of this ſervice, and the Towne of <hi>Trailſound,</hi> the Citizens of it, before this time being ſluggiſh, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, cowards, ſpend-thrifts and voluptuous, are now by this Diſcipline made active, menagers, valiant, ſparing and honeſt: the thankes whereof they owe unto our Nation, whoſe bones lie in their ground, and to our Country-man, who ſince hath beene their Governour, for the reward of his vertue, was appointed by his Majeſtie of <hi>Sweden,</hi> of worthy memory, and ſet to Command over them and their Citie. And it is moſt ſure,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="O"/> that the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of good diſcipline is the maintaining of Kingdomes, Cities, and Common-wealths, making them to flouriſh; where diſcipline is well kept, as it was here during our beleagering, for then we had no thought of gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of money, but of gaining of credit; here were no Novices, but expert Souldiers to reſiſt both the craft and valour of their enemies, who did feele the ſmart of their valourous reſiſtance, in heaping their dead bodies one upon another in the graffe.</p>
               <p>During the time of this hot conflict, none that was whole went off at the coming of the reliefe, but continued in the fight aſſiſting their Camerades, ſo long as their ſtrength ſerved, ever eſteeming more of their credit than of their ſafetie, through the deſire they had to be revenged of the loſſes ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by their Camerades. On the other part, it was reported of <hi>Waleſtine,</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:132555:45"/>that he was ſo eager to get in the Towne, that his Officers retiring off ſervce being hurt, he cauſed to ſhoot them dead, calling them Cowards for retiring with ſo ſmall hurt. Here alſo I purpoſe to ſpeake ſomewhat of the <hi>Emperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts</hi> cuſtome, entring on ſervice, ſhouting like <hi>Turkes,</hi> as if crying would ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie reſolute Souldiers: No truely; we were more encouraged, having long expected for their coming, being all of us well reſolved for the Combat, we were greedie of honour, and therefore we longed to try our enemies valour: Seeing we were more overjoyed of their coming, than any wiſe terrified; and we received them with Volees of Cannon and Musket in their teeth, which faire and well come was hard of digeſtion unto ſome of them: and it might be well ſaid of them,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="P"/> as the <hi>Proverbe</hi> is amongſt the <hi>Bactrians,</hi> that the dogges did barke more than they did bite, eſpecially the Fleete Curres; for true courage conſiſts not in words, neither ought we to looke for much cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, where we heare many boyſterous words. But on the contrary, true valour doth conſiſt in the greatneſſe of courage, and in the ſtrength of the valiant Arme, and not in the Tongue: and the firſt people, that did practiſe this lowde crying of martiall reſolution, and of rejoycing in battell, were the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who in the moſt part of their fighting uſed thoſe cryes, as teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of their faith, and of their earneſt calling for the helpe of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And a Lord of <hi>Africke</hi> being to fight againſt the <hi>Portugalls,</hi> his Troopes ready to fight, he ſaid unto them, they ſhould not cry but ſtrike hard, for ſaith he, thoſe men whom you ſee, are not accuſtomed to be afraide with words nor voyce; for it is not in cryes, but in valour, that men ſhould eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the hope of Victory. Nevertheleſſe, we reade in Hiſtories, that the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and other warlike Nations, were wont in Battells, as to this day in approaches, even as in fields, to cry alowd: and therefore we ſay among our ſelves at home, that he is to be pittied, that is ſurprized with the cry of his Enemies. We reade alſo of the <hi>Savages,</hi> whom the <hi>French</hi> doe call <hi>Tokniam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bous,</hi> that before they come within halfe a mile, they cry like Devills at the firſt ſight of their enemies, redoubling their cryes coming neare hand, ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their hornes, lifting their Armes here and there in a boaſting manner, fighting ſo long as they are able to move hand or foote, never giving ground or turning backe till they die.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tacitus</hi> reports, that the <hi>Germanes</hi> of old, did ſing going to fight: and wee reade of <hi>Cate</hi> the <hi>Cenſor,</hi> that he taught young men to fight ſtanding in one place, and he uſed to ſay often, that words were more powerfull to terrifie, and to chaſe an enemy, than the ſtroaks of the hand. And the ſame <hi>Cato</hi> ſaid, he loved not the Souldier that did ſhake his hands marching, that ſtaggred with his feet in fighting, &amp; ſnorted lowder in ſleeping, than he did cry coming to fight. And <hi>Cæſar</hi> ſaid, that in every man was ſeene a certaine moving and naturall readineſſe and promptitude, that kindled them with a deſire to fight: which Generalls and Commanders of Armies ought diligently to intertaine, and not extinguiſh.


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Q"/> Wherefore it was, that the Ancients before they fought, cauſed to ſound their Trumpets, beate their Drummes, and made their Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers cry hard, eſteeming that did encourage their Troopes, and affright their enemies.

If then we ſhould cry at all, let it be ſuch a noiſe as may terrifie our enemies, being ſtrong, couragious, and brave.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plutarch</hi> reports, that the cry of Souldiers made a Raven flying in the ayre to fall downe being aſtoniſhed: and <hi>Titus Livius</hi> ſaith, that when the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of people did imbarke, that few or none were left in <hi>Italie</hi> and <hi>Sicile,</hi> coming together, and crying, the Birds aſtoniſhed fell out of the ayre: and <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> reports the like, that when the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> beſieged <hi>Tyre,</hi> a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon was ſeene in the Ayre, which made the <hi>Christians</hi> raiſe ſuch a noiſe, that the Pigeon fell downe, as if it had beene ſtricken with thunder, and that they found a Letter about the necke of the Pigeon, that the <hi>Sarazens</hi> had ſent to the beſieged, ſhewing they ſhould be ſoone relieved, if they would take good courage, and maintaine the Towne for certaine dayes: and the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> having men with them, who underſtood the ſame language, did write another Letter, which they tyed to the necke of the ſaid Pigeon, and let him goe; which Letter carried, that the beſieged had neede to looke to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they had given good proofe of their valour and fidelitie, and that their Fortune was, not to give them hope of reliefe; the paſſages being clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up by their enemies, and the <hi>Tyrians</hi> thus deceived, give over the Towne unto the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The like we reade practized at the ſiege of <hi>Harlam,</hi> which made the Towne hold out long: and it is certaine, ſuch Poaſts are made fall downe with the noiſe of crying, and of Cannon and Musket, ſo that their packetts are taken from them. Here alſo was wonderfull, the loſſe and dammage done by Cannon, eſpecially the Morters of the enemy, carrying Bullets of Stone within the Towne of three hundreth pound weight,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="R"/> and ſome that carried Bullets of one hundreth and ſixtie pound, and in one day there were ſhot on the Port of <hi>Franckendore,</hi> where we went out to our watch, above ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth and ſixtie ſhot of Cannon, the noiſe whereof was heard above thirtie <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles. Alſo we reade, that at the Battell of <hi>Lepanto,</hi> in the yeare 1572. where the <hi>Turkes</hi> were defeated with great loſſe, that the noiſe of the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non was heard from the place, above ſixtie <hi>Scottiſh</hi> miles. But on the Sea they are heard a great deale farther, as having neither hill nor wood to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſound in the Ayre.</p>
               <p>Here alſo I did obſerve, how happie it is when Officers and Souldiers love one another, refuſing to undertake no danger to ſupply their <hi>Camerades,</hi> their lives being dearer unto them than their owne: which was evident by the timely reliefe, which diſcouraged the Enemy, and made them at laſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving their owne loſſe to be great, having effectuated little, in the end to ſettle. To ſpeake in particular of any mans valour, at this time, ſeeing to my knowledge, I perceived no defect neither in Officer nor Souldier; but ſo
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:132555:46"/>farre as to my griefe, I did ſpeake of the <hi>Dutch</hi> that left their Captaine, which ſince I confeſſe to be a warlike Nation, being now long hardned by the cuſtome of warres, but on deſperate ſervice, as this was, I would wiſh, if I had libertie to chooſe, other ſeconds: neither can I commend thoſe <hi>Dutch</hi> that would not ſend us reliefe in our great danger; for though we ought to looke to our owne houſes, when our neighbours are on fire, yet Chriſtian compaſſion ought to move us to ſupply the defects of our brethren; but when Souldiers and Officers preferre their eaſe,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="S"/> with whole skinnes, to the ſafetie of their <hi>Camerades</hi> in danger, then ſuch may be juſtly called ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, without moderation, abandoning their <hi>Camerades,</hi> they loſe their good name, and bring their reputation and valour in queſtion.

Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, if we could thinke of lifes caſualties, we would neither be careleſſe nor covetous. What availes then a man, to exhauſt his very vitals, for the hoording up of fatall gold, not thinking how a haire or a flie may ſnatch him in a moment from it? Why ſhould we then ſtraine our ſelves for more than is convenient? We ſhould never care too much for that we are not ſure to keepe; yet we ſhould reſpect ſomewhat more than for our owne time, that we may be beneficiall to poſteritie; but for mine owne part, I will caſt this, as my life on Gods providence, and live here as a <hi>Pilgrime</hi> of one night, not being ſure to ſee the morrow.</p>

               <p>THe Lievetenant Colonell having viſited me the next day at my lodging, being not able to ſtirre out of my bed, he declared unto me the loſſe ſuſtained by the Regiment, both of Officers and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and he ſuſpecting the enemy would ſtorme againe at night, being battering the walles furiouſly the whole day,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="W"/> having ſhot at <hi>Frankendore</hi> neere eight hundred ſhot, he deſired to heare my opinion, how I would have the Poaſte beſet at night with the Regiment; my adviſe was, to cauſe beate a bancke by the Drummer Major; and the whole Drummers of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment athwart the City, commanding upon paine of death, that all Officers, and Souldiers able to carry Armes under the Regiment ſhould repaire at parad time, to the market place, there to receive further orders, and that at their coming, to appoint all the Officers, that were not hurt, to command the whole Souldiers, to be all put under the Colonells company, till ſuch
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:132555:47"/>time, as the Recreuts ſhould come from <hi>Scotland,</hi> and then every man ſhould be ſuffered to ſerve againe under their owne companies, as before, and this order being followed, they would be well commanded having ſufficient Officers to leade them, giving them orders how to behave themſelves, in caſe the enemy ſhould ſtorme their workes, ſeeing they were not able to defend them long, being weake of forces, and the workes almoſt ruin'd the night before.</p>
               <p>This determined, the watch being drawne up, they march to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Poaſt, getting orders from the Lievetenant Colonell, if the enemy ſhould preſſe them hard, they ſhould retire themſelves orderly to the Rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, and quit the outer workes, ſeeing that from the Towne wall, and Ravelin, they were able with Cannon and musket to cleanſe out the enemy againe.</p>
               <p>So entring on their watch, and the night being come on, the enemy furiouſly did invade them, and they defended the workes a long time, till in the end being preſt hard, they retired according to their orders, to the Ravelin, whereupon the enemy followed them with a ſhout and a cry, as if the Towne had beene wonne, which did put the Burgars, and the reſt of the Souldiers that were on other Poaſts, in great feare, thinking all was paſt recovery.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding of this ſudden feare, our Souldiers valiantly and brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defended the Ravelin with Pikes and fire-workes, the enemy having advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced bravely to the cutting of the <hi>Palleſſades,</hi> preſſing alſo to undermine the Ravelin by working under it, which our folkes did hinder, by counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineing.</p>
               <p>The enemy alſo, had another fortell, or advantage by reaſon of a new worke, which was uncomplete, betwixt the Ravelin and the outward workes, where he did lodge himſelfe, having the new workes as a Breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke, to defend him from our ſhot.</p>
               <p>The night thus paſt furiouſly on both ſides, not without great loſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well fought, both of the purſuer and defender, in the morning our Souldiers ſome of them being Armed with Corſlets, head-peeces, withhalfe pikes, Morgan ſternes and ſwords, being led with reſolute Officers they fall out, Pell mell amongſt the enemies, and chaſe them quite out of the workes againe, and retiring with credit, maintained ſtill the Triangle or Ravelin; The enemy conſidering his loſſe, and how little he had gained, the Towne alſo being not void of feare, thinking the third night, the enemy might enter the walles, being thus doubtfull on both ſides, the enemy ſends a Trumpeter, to know if they will treate for conditions, our Lievete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Colonell having the command, for the time (in Colonell <hi>Holke</hi> his abſence) I thinke was glad of the offer, to prolong time, till his Majeſty of <hi>Denmark</hi> might ſend a freſh ſupply. Pledges delivered <hi>hinc inde,</hi> a ſtill-ſtand or ceſſation of Armes was concluded on by both parties, for a formights time, then Articles were drawne up, to be adviſed on, which continued in adviſing certaine dayes,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> in the end the treaty being almoſt agreed on, to the ſubſcription, orders come to our Lievetenant Colonell to diſſolve the treaty, ſeeing his Majeſty of <hi>Denmark</hi> had folke in readineſſe to come in all haſte with Colonell <hi>Holke,</hi> for their reliefe. Whereupon my Lord <hi>Spynie,</hi> a <hi>Scots</hi> Noble man, with his Regiment, with ſufficient proviſion of money and Amunition, were ſent unto the Towne, and being entred, the treaty was rejected, and made voide.</p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:132555:47"/>
               <p>At this time alſo Sr. <hi>Alexander Leſly,</hi> (an expert and a valorous <hi>Scots</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander) with ſome <hi>Swedens</hi> forces, was ſent to governe the Towne, his Majeſty of <hi>Sweden</hi> having condeſcended with his Majeſty of <hi>Denmark,</hi> that his Majeſty of <hi>Denmark</hi> ſhould diſmiſſe the protection of <hi>Traileſound</hi> in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of his Majeſty of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and to that effect the <hi>Danes</hi> forces ſhould be drawne out of the Garriſon, for to give place to the <hi>Swedens;</hi> in the meane time, the command was turned over upon Sr. <hi>Alexander Leſly,</hi> whom Colonell <hi>Holke</hi> did aſſiſt with the <hi>Danes</hi> forces, till they were removed, the abſolute command being given to Sr. <hi>Alexander Leſly,</hi> as Governour for his Maj ſty of <hi>Sweden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In time of the ſtill-ſtand, I tooke a foare loffe under my Lievetenant Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell his hand, &amp; ſcale, to goe by Sea to <hi>Copmanhagen,</hi> to be cured there, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Chirurgian in <hi>Traileſound</hi> would undertake to cut the bullet out of my knee, without hazarding me to be lame, which to prevent, I chooſed rather, though with infinite paine, to keepe the bullet a fortnight, till I came to <hi>Copmanhagen,</hi> where happily I found better cure.</p>

               <head>The eighteenth Obſervation.</head>
               <p>TWo things we muſt reſpect, ſo long as we live,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Y"/> our inward inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, and our outward uprightneſſe, our piety towards God, and our reputation amongſt men, the one makes our life famous, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our death happy, ſo both together bring credit to the name, and felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the ſoule, Then whenſoever our breath is made but aire, we ſhall be bleſſed, leaving a ſweete odour behinde us, and men will regrate our loſſe, as at this time they did our hurt.</p>
               <p>He whom before I was wont to obey and viſite, came now, and viſited me, I not being able to ſtirre, my Lievetenant Colonell came to comfort me, having neede to be comforted himſelfe by good adviſe, how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the workes the ſecond night, a generall feare having poſſeſſed the hearts both of Burgers and Souldiers, and I, to encourage him, did tell him a ſtory of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> the Emperour, who being neere death commanded, that after his deceaſe, all his friends ſhould clap their hands, and laugh unfainedly, as the cuſtome was when a Comedy was well acted: even ſo ſaid I, though I was ſorry at our loſſe; yet I was glad for being hurt, when I looked to be kill'd, and having acted my part of the play, for that time, and retired off the Stage, all I could doe was but to minde my Camerads of their duties. In the meane time, the Enemies cannon having ſhot foure great bullets of a hundred and ſixty pound weight, out of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, through the top of my lodging even to the bottome, where I did lie, affrighting me ſtill, when my feete were not able to ſhift away my body; yet recommending my ſoule to God, I reſolved, he was well guarded, whom the Lord had a care of, and having delivered me from many dangers, I ſtill confided he would not ſuffer me to be ſmother'd under walles: For which and all his bleſſings I doe infinitly thanke his Majeſty, in giveing me time to doe any thing, that may pleaſe his Majeſty, for my deliverance.</p>
               <p>To make my Lievetenant Colonell laugh,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Z"/> I did tell him a ſtory of a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that was ſeene by a Souldier of the Colonells company, that morning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the enemy did ſtorme, being a predictive dreame, and a true. One <hi>Murdo Mac-claude</hi> borne in <hi>Aſſen,</hi> a Souldier of a tall ſtature, and valiant
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:132555:48"/>courage, being ſleeping on his watch, awakened by the breake of day, and jogges two of his Camerades lying by him, who did finde much fault with him for ſturring of them, he replied, before long you ſhall be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſturred, a Souldier called <hi>Allen Tough a Loghaber-man,</hi> recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his ſoule to God, asked him what he had ſeene, who anſwered him, you ſhall never ſee your country againe, the other replyed, the loſſe was but ſmall if the reſt of the company were well, he anſwered no, for there was great hurt and death of many very neere, the other asked againe, whom had he ſeene more, that would dye beſides him, ſundry of his Camerades he tould by name, that ſhould be killed: the other asked what would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of himſelfe, he anſwered, he would be killed with the reſt: in effect, he deſcribeth the whole Officers by their cloathes that ſhould be hurt: a pretty quicke boy neere by asked him, what would become of the Major, meaning me, he anſwered, he would be ſhot, but not deadly, and that the boy ſhould be next unto me, when I were hurt, as he was.</p>
               <p>This diſcourſe ended, I wiſhed my Lievetenant Colonell to ſet all care a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide and to looke to himſelfe, and to the credit of his Nation, in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the place, till the reliefe ſhould come, and ſo we parted.</p>
               <p>Here I did obſerve, that no city, be it never ſo ſtrong, or ſo well beſet, nor no Armour, be it of what proofe it will, is able to encourage a fearefull heart, as in this City, and at this time, were many of the Burgars, Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſtrangers, Officers, of women and children, who were tormented by the feare of death, and of their meanes, whoſe feare was generally ſo great, that they were bereft both of wiſdome, and courage, as people given over, ſo that their feare in ſome ſort did fruſtrate their lawfull defences: the like I did never ſee, neither wiſh to ſee againe, for the enemy could not, though victorious, put them in a worſe habit, nor make them ſeeme more miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="&amp;."/> than I did ſee them at this time, making themſelves unfit to reſiſt their enemies, and they were all of them in mine eyes, like to the ſword<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh, having weapons, but they wanted hearts; they had quaking hands without uſe: and in a word, if the enemy had ſeene them, as I did, he would rather pitty them as cowards, then kill them like gallants.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding of this feare, which poſſeſſed the burgars, and thoſe Souldiers that had not beene on occaſion, yet our Nation, that are ever moſt couragious in greateſt extremity, failed nothing of their wonted va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, but having once retired to the Ravelin, maintained it couragiouſly, repelling the enemies valour, with reſolution built on vertue, and love of credit, ſo that they made their enemie with great loſſe, to be fruſtrate of his hoped for victory, finding the valour of the <hi>Scots</hi> tempered with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant reſolution and vigorous ſpirits, his fury was made to ſetle by little and little, till at laſt, reſolution, the ſtrong Armour of the deſcreete Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier prevailed againſt all the ſhuffles and cries of the enemy, and the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſeeing the ſtorme paſt, and the tempeſt ceaſe, he laughes and ſmiles, with as much honour, quiet and ſafety, as before he ſuffered toyle, griefe, or injury.</p>
               <p>Here we ſee the uſe of treaty, and ſtill-ſtand (or truce) ordained of Policy, that every man may preſſe to winne his owne aymes. The Souldiers that in ſix weekes before, were wounding, and killing one another, are now coming and diſcourſing together as friends, where I did remarke and obſerve, that it is much eaſier to be reconciled with an enemy, then to conquer him.</p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:132555:48"/>
               <p>Now in time of theſe ſtill-ſtands, by diſcourſe they preſſe to finde out one anothers actions, and to obſerve one anothers faults and excurſions, treaſuring up againſt the day of advantage, for the confounding of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, at their firſt out-falling, and like the <hi>Crocodile,</hi> they ſlime one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers way, to make one another fall, coming in occaſions againe: and therefore it was the anſwere that <hi>Seneca</hi> gave unto himſelfe, when he asked <hi>Quid eſt homini inimiciſsimum?</hi> he anſwered, <hi>Alter homo.</hi> Our enemies ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are the plots of our ruine, leaving nothing unattempted, which may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce our dammage, and the danger is ever moſt, when we ſee it not. Yet I thinke, he that can be a worthy enemy, can, reconciled, be a worthy friend; and he that, in a juſt cauſe, can fight againſt us,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> can likewiſe in the like cauſe, being reconciled, fight with us, and if he be unworthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile him too, if it were but to be freed of his ſcandalous tongue, and that alſo will be worth thy labour, and he that upon good termes refuſeth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilement, may be ſtubborne, but not valiant nor wiſe: for he that wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully continues an enemy, teacheth his enemy to do him a miſchiefe if he can: and that endeavour is well ſpent, that unmaskes an enemy, or makes a friend: for as the one begets a treaſure; the other, it may be, raiſeth a ſiege; and that man is wiſe, that is kinde to his friends and ſharpe to his enemies: but he is wiſer, that can entertaine his friends in love, and make his enemies like them, as our Nation did here at <hi>Traileſound,</hi> in keeping their Maſters love to the beſt, for their loyalty, and in making their enemies thinke well of them, and love them for their brave carriage and valour.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe I did obſerve here the benefit that ariſeth to a Kingdome, City or State through a good Government; and what a bleſſing it was to a Towne perplexed, as this was, to get a good, wiſe, vertuous and valiant Governour, in time of their greateſt trouble, which ſhewes that we are govern'd by a power above us: for oftimes, that, which we deſire or feare, doth ſeldome happen. This City having feared the Emperours tyranny to come over them, deſired the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> as their protector, yet God, by his providence, gave them another, to wit, the invincible King of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> who provided them an able Governour in their greateſt neede, to wit, Sr. <hi>Alexander Leſly,</hi> who immediatly after his entry tooke the command upon him, keeping both the <hi>Dane,</hi> their Souldiers, and the Burgars under his command, and direction, as worthy of his authority, flowing from the King his Maſter of moſt famous and of never dying memory, it faring then with <hi>Traileſound,</hi> as with <hi>Sara;</hi>


                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ſhe became fruitfull when ſhe could not believe it, and they became flouriſhing having gotten a <hi>Scots</hi> Governour to protect them, whom they looked not for, which was a good <hi>Omen</hi> unto them, to get a Governour of the Nation, that was never conquered, which made them the onely Towne in <hi>Germany</hi> free, as yet, from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall yoake, by the valour of our Nation, that defended their City in their greateſt danger.</p>
               <p>To conclude then, for the love I beare to the Crowne, that doth protect them, knowing their diſpoſitions by experience to be froward, factious, and proud, having as yet ſome Wolves amongſt them, that the folde may be quiet, let the factious heads be made higher by a pole than their bodies, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the tumultuous; whereby their Governour, by a majeſticke awe, may keepe the reſt in a ſtrict ſubjection, leſt ſlackneſſe and connivence may undermine an unſetled Government; for it is no crueltie to denie falſe men
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:132555:49"/>libertie, that are ſo infected, though there be ſome honeſt men amongſt them; let them ſerve their Governour, and let him beare the ſway, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the dignitie of the place, that having once wonne the field, he may be ſure to keepe it: for though I hate the evill people, for their former unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe to our Souldiers and Nation, yet the love I beare to their Protector and Governour, makes me thus plaine; whoſe happineſſe I wiſh to endure while there remaineth a ſtone in the Citie, and his fame eternally.</p>

The enemy having falne ſtrong a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Majeſtie, he did plant fourteen pieces of Ordnance, and playd on the Kings battell, till his Majeſtie perceiving the danger, not being baſtant to reſiſt the enemy, retired confuſedly in great haſte to <hi>Wolgast;</hi> and having loſt without fighting the greateſt part of his Armie, our Regiment and the remnant of <hi>Spynies</hi> Regiment had beene cut off,

His Majeſtie finding the enemy preſſing hard, fearing much to be ſurprized or taken, he did give Captaine <hi>Mac-Kenyee</hi> charge to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Neither can we ſo ſlenderly forget their memory, being our noble friends, and who were ornaments to our Regiment and Country, and helpers of our credits.

               <p>IN the Firmament we ſee all things are preſerved by a glorious order; the Sunne hath his appointed circuite, the Moone her conſtant change, and every planet and Starre their proper courſe and place, the Earth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo hath her unſtirred ſtations, the Sea is confined in limits, and in his ebbing and flowing dances, as it were, after the influence and aſpect of the Moone, whereby it is kept from putrefaction, and by ſtrugling with it ſelfe, from over flowing the land. So that in this world, order is the life of Kingdoms, Honours, Artes: for by the excellency of it, all things floriſh and thrive; and therefore we ſee, that this order is requiſite to be obſerved in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than in military diſcipline, being the life of it. Regiments then maintained in good order, the Army can be but well ordered, and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my well ordered, the King and country cannot but ſtand, both in peace and warre, for ſeldome we ſee any goodneſſe in the refuſing to obey good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. And we heare ordinarily, that one bad voice puts twenty out of tune, and that it is the chiefe property of a good Souldier, firſt to learne to obey well, in keeping of good order, and then doubtleſſe, in time being advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, he cannot but command well, ſo that here in ordering of this, as in all things, we ſee viciſſitudes and alterations, ſome Regiments made up and continue in floriſhing order, other Regiments reduced taking an end, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion and accidents of warre doe happen, <hi>Spynies</hi> Regiment was reduced, and my Lord of <hi>Rhees</hi> Regiment is made up againe. Where we ſee, that as viciſſitude maintaines the world; even ſo concord is a great meanes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, as diſcord is too often of diſcontinuance, and ruine. Likewiſe we ſee, that no eſtate is free from mutability, and change, which is the great Lord of the World, who will be adored and followed as ſoone as order doth faile: but where order is kept,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and concord (as in this Regiment) change hath no place to ruine, though well to alter; for order was ſo kept by this Regiment, like to brave Souldiers, who in a running skirmiſh come up, diſcharge, fall off, flie, and yet reinforce themſelves againe, having kept order in their proceedings, which though now ſhe admits of ſome change, being reinforced againe and joyned together with the chaine of love and reſpect, ſhe admits of no confuſion or ruine; but is ready againe with her brave Souldiers being reinforced in a ſtrong body to make head unto their enemies, one day to be revenged of their former loſſes, as, God willing, ſhall be cleered in the ſequell of my diſcharge of dueties and obſervations, of this new reformed body of the old Regiment.</p>
               <p>My cozen Lievetenant <hi>Andrew Monro</hi> being killed in combat, I have more then reaſon to condemne and diſallow of that miſerable ſort of fight, where oftimes the victorious puts himſelfe in a worſe caſe, both of ſoule and body, than he that is killed. Yet this kinde of fighting hand to hand, called <hi>Monomachia,</hi> hath bin much practiſed, both amongſt <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> even amongſt all Nations, as it is yet. Of old it did ſerve for
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:132555:52"/>proofe of things hidden, being in one rancke with the burning iron, and ſcalding water, to the end men might diſcerne the innocent from the guilty: this kinde of violence of proofe was ſo common, that <hi>Fronton</hi> King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> made a law, as reports the <hi>Saxon</hi> hiſtory, that all differences whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhould be decided by the combat, and <hi>Leoden</hi> reports, that yet to this day they obſerve the ſame in <hi>Muſcove.</hi> But wiſe men finding this cuſtome deceivable, in deciding the truth, and ſo uncertaine, that many times the innocent doth ſuccumbe; and therefore it was forbidden by the civill, and canon law, as is evident by ſeverall ancient conſtitutions, inſerted in the Decretalls.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding whereof, amongſt the <hi>Romans</hi> it became ſo common, as to be thought but a ſport; which made the name of fighters eſteemed of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> as we reade in the <hi>Cod. Titulo de gladiatortbus,</hi> and therefore this cuſtome being diſpleaſing unto the Emperour <hi>Iuſtinian,</hi> he commanded all ſhould be ſubject unto the Iudge, and ſaid, that valour with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out juſtice, was not to be allowed of. This combat betwixt thoſe two was well fought of both, in preſence of many witneſſes; where it was thought, that the <hi>Dutch-man</hi> was hard, ſo that a ſword could neither pierce him, nor cut him. This faſhion of fighting is ſo common, that we neede not illuſtrate it by examples of Hiſtories, either ancient or moderne; but who ſo would ſatisfie their curioſity in this point, let them but reade <hi>Preaſack</hi> his <hi>Cleander,</hi> a ſtory well worth the reading. And truely dayly experience teacheth us (as in this accident) that the end of combats doth ſhew often that he,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales, often times doth receive the reward of his temerite, which might be cleered by many examples, amongſt the ancients. We have one very notable, written by <hi>Quintus Curtius,</hi> where <hi>Dioxippus</hi> the <hi>Athenian,</hi> that brave fighter being all naked, and ſmered over with oyle, as the faſhion was then, with a hat of flowers on his head, carrying about his left Arme a red ſleeve, and in the right hand a great batton of hard greene timber, durſt enter in combat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Horrat Macedonian</hi> carrying on his left Arme a bucler of braſſe, and a ſhort pike in the right hand, a jacdart-ſtaffe as we terme it, or ſomething like it, and a ſword by his ſide: at their approaching, <hi>Dioxippus</hi> with a nimble ſlight, and a pretty cunning ſhift of his body, eſchewed the ſtabbe or thruſt of the ſtaffe, and before the <hi>Macedonian</hi> could have wielded the Pike, the other doth breake it in two with his cudgell, and quickly cloſing with his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary gives him ſuch a knocke on the ſhinnes, that he fell to the ground, his heeles above his head, tooke his ſword from him, and would have kill'd him with his batton, had not the King ſaved him. Thus much of combats, which for my part, though I cannot allow of, nevertheleſſe I ſhould be loath to refuſe to fight in a juſt quarrell, but would rather referre the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe to God, to determine of, then to let that be called in queſtion, which is deareſt unto me.</p>

For we reade that the favour of the Lord was in <hi>Iuda,</hi> in giving them one heart in doing, and obeying the commandements of the King, and of their Magiſtrates and Principalls, as I did cleerely obſerve in this Kingdome of <hi>Denmarke</hi> the goodneſſe of government, for the floriſhing of the Kingdome; where <hi>Totus orbis componebatur ad exemplum Regis.</hi> He commanding, they obeyed; both lived in proſperity, the Ruler or King Heroick, wiſe, noble, magnanimous and worthy.</p>
               <p>The Gentry, Citizens and Communalty obedient, which made their joy and felicity to continue, in deſpite of their mighty foes, and that by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his Majeſties Government in military diſcipline, who doth entertaine a great number of Officers yeerely, having good allowance for comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Souldiers trained up in peace, againſt warre, ſuch as Colonells, Lievetenant-Colonells, Majors, Captaines and other inferiour Officers, which are ſtill entertained at the countries charge, in exerciſing of Souldiers for his Majeſties emploiment, being alike ever ready in all Provinces for peace or warre. Would to God we were ſo well provided in our owne country at home, and then we needed not to feare any forraine enemy, that are enemies to God, to our King, and to our Religion.</p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:132555:53"/>
               <p>And for the better maintaining of warre, no Kingdome or King I know, is better provided of a <hi>Magazin,</hi> then this magnanimous King, for Armes, braſſe ordnance (whereof every yeere his Majeſty doth caſt above a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred peeces) being ſufficiently provided of Amunition and of all ſorts of fiery <hi>Engines,</hi> to be uſed by Sea or Land, together with Armour ſufficient for to arme a great Armie of Horſe. His Majeſtie is alſo ſufficiently well provided of ſhipping, and yearely doth adde to the number, which ſhips are built by two worthy Scottiſh-men, called Mr. <hi>Balfoure,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sinclaire,</hi> being both well accounted off by his Majeſtie, who in like manner hath a Reprobane at <hi>Copmanhagen,</hi> for making of Cords and Cables for his ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and Kingdome, where I was informed, that in twenty foure houres time, they were able to furniſh the greateſt ſhip the King had, of Cables and of all other tackling and cordage, neceſſary to ſet out the Ship.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe by his Majeſties Artizens within the Kingdome, all ſort of ſtuffes and ſilkes are woven, ſufficient to ſerve the Kingdome, and his neighbours that pleaſe to buy.</p>
               <p>Moreover this Kingdome is worthy commendation, for the order of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Lawes, having their Law-books deciding all controverſies amongſt them, and if it come to any great difference, the Kings Majeſtie, as being above the Law, ſits in judgement as the Interpreter and Director of Iuſtice, and according to his Princely dignity, mitigates as pleaſeth his Majeſtie the law, and decides the controverſie.</p>
               <p>This Kingdome alſo is praiſe-worthy, for the purity of their Gentry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as ancient and noble, as any other Kingdome, and can bragge of a puter and cleerer bloud of Gentility, then many Nations can: for they never ally or enter into marriage with any inferiour to themſelves, be they never ſo rich, if they be Burgars or Plebeians, they never marry with them; and if one of their daughters will, through love, miſcarry in her affection, to marry a Citizen, they will not thereafter doe ſo much as to honour her with their company, but on the contrary, ſhee loſeth both her portion and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, not ſuffering her to carry the armes of her familie.</p>
               <p>Moreover, this Nation is praiſe-worthy for their entertaining of learning, and of the liberall Sciences profeſſed in their owne Vniverſities, where their children are well taught and trained up, after a noble and heroick manner, within their owne Kingdome, not onely in their Studies of the liberall Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, but alſo in their exerciſe of body, as fencing, dancing, ſinging, play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Inſtruments, and riding of horſes, and what elſe are noble Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as learning of forraine languages, <hi>Spaniſh, Italian, French, Dutch,</hi> and ſuch like, and afterwards their youth being well travell'd, returning from their Travells, they attend on the Chancellarie, as under-Secretaries to States-men, to enable them to be profitable members in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale. And being <hi>foris familiat,</hi> according to their gifts and qualities, they are preferred to Government and charges under his Majeſtie, in all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of the Kingdome of <hi>Denmarke, Tewtland, Holsten,</hi> and <hi>Norway.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Majeſtie alſo is praiſe-worthy, for his <hi>Oeconomie</hi> in keeping of Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes to feed Oxen, and ſtalles for keeping of milch Cowes, whereof is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived yearely great income of moneys, for Butter and Cheeſe made in great quantitie by <hi>Hollanders</hi> in <hi>Denmarke, Holſten,</hi> and <hi>Yewtland:</hi> which parts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound alſo with all ſorts of Fiſh, which inricheth his Majeſties treaſure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely, together with their trading by Sea to the fiſhing in <hi>Greeneland,</hi>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:132555:54"/>bringing great commoditie to the Subjects, in ſerving themſelves, as alſo in bringing of money into the Kingdome, by furniſhing of others. Alſo this Land abounds in Corne, which makes great cheapneſſe in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, where I have lived nobly entertained with two ſervants for twelve ſhillings ſterling a weeke, being a whole winter in Garriſon at <hi>Malemce</hi> in <hi>Skoneland.</hi> Where I did ſee and obſerve the cuſtome uſed by the <hi>Danes</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie in their houſe-keeping, wherein they are not prodigall, but yet very no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, not differing much from our owne cuſtomes at home, entertaining many perſons attendant, but not with coſtly or daintie fare, but aboundant in meate and drinke; obliging alſo they are in entertaining ſtrangers of faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; they keepe long Tables, at which there ſit ſometimes above thirtie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: ordinary Tables they uſe beſides, ordained for the attendants of the familie, who ſit not till their Maſters have halfe din 'd or ſup't: they keepe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo many horſes, hounds and hawkes, with attendance anſwerable, which makes their families great.</p>
               <p>Here I did obſerve, that the Subjects doe follow the example of their King, in their apparrell, in their vertues, and Oeconomie, where I did ſee vertue to have beene alike habituall in King, Gentry, Citizens, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, being all in their degrees extraordinary rich, not onely in money, but alſo in Iewells and plate; nothing inferiour, in my judgement, to any neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Country. It was obſerved in the Court of the Emperour <hi>Maximilian</hi> the ſecond, a good Prince and a vertuous, that many Lords and great Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieurs not onely clad themſelves according to the colour he wore, but alſo had the ſame veſſells and moveables: the greateſt Ladies alſo followed the Empreſſe; ſo that thoſe kindes of cloathing that before were diſdained and out of requeſt, were then followed, all being clad with skinnes and leather. The Emperour and the Empreſſe not diſdaining to carry and weare them, the reſt followed: the pearles and precious ſtones did riſe to the great price, that they are now at by the rich, that made the price ſo high, that the poore could not attaine unto them. To ſhew this by example, we reade of <hi>Sabina Poppæa,</hi> to whom nothing was wanting, but ſhame and honeſtie, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely beloved of <hi>Nero,</hi> had the colour of her haire yellow, like Amber, which <hi>Nero</hi> eſteemed much of, in ſinging Verſes made on her on the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern: and from this came that the whole Damſels of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Italie</hi> did like beſt to have that colour of haire in their Buskins, Bracelets and cloathing, and the Amber, which before was in no eſteeme, became very deare, ſeeing <hi>Nero</hi> eſteemed of it; which makes <hi>Plinie</hi> report, ſpeaking of the Comoedians apparell, that they carried ſo much Amber, that it was admirable to behold; which ſhewes, that the examples of great perſonages have great power, in matters of moment and conſequence, as it hath in things of leſſe impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>For as <hi>Villeius Paterculus</hi> ſpake of the Emperour <hi>Augustus,</hi> a good Prince teacheth his Subjects to doe well, and as he is the greateſt in eſtate, even ſo he is the greateſt in example, the people caſting their eyes on their Prince, ſitting high, in ſight of all, they delight narrowly to conſider all he doth and ſaith, and they looke unto the moſt hidden things of his actions, as through little holes: and therefore before all places, the Kings Court ought to be holieſt, and cleereſt of all vices, and endued with moſt honeſtie, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times will make the whole Kingdome conforme. To confirme this, we reade in our owne ſtory a memorable example; how the King <hi>Ioſina</hi> tooke
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:132555:54"/>pleaſure and delight to diſcourſe much with Phyſicians and Chirurgians; in a ſhort time the Lords and Gentrie did accommodate themſelves to the Princes humour, that many ages after, there was no noble familie in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that was not expert and well taught in dreſſing and healing the wounds of the body. A knowledge very neceſſary for men of our profeſſion, that oft-times are loſt for want of good cure. And we reade, that King IAMES the fourth, following the laudable cuſtome of his Anceſtors, was very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in this kinde, in healing of wounds. A noble knowledge of ſo noble a Prince, and ſo great a Captaine, as he was! And the common Proverbe is, that the little prettie dogges or puppies doe any thing to pleaſe their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes; and we ſay, he ſmells of the pot he hath licked. Here then you ſee the power of good and bad examples.</p>
               <p>To conclude then. Let us learne by the good examples aforeſaid, to follow the vertuous examples of our noble Maſter and King, not neglecting the ſervice and dutie we owe to the King of Kings, ſince our lives here are but like bubbles of the water, now ſeene, now vaniſht.</p>

               <p>Being retyred from the paſſe, immediately I did ſend a Boore on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe, in the night, to acquaint his Majeſty of <hi>Sweden</hi> (the Army then lying at <hi>Statine</hi> twenty <hi>Dutch</hi> miles from us) with the manner of our hard landing, and of our happy ſucceſſe after landing; as likewiſe, diſiring to know his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties will, how I ſhould behave my ſelfe in thoſe Quarters, the Enemy being ſtrong, and I very weake, his Majeſty returned for reſolution unto me, that I ſhould doe my beſt to fortifie, and beſet the paſſes, that were betwixt me and the Enemy, and to keepe good watch, and good order over the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and not to ſuffer them to wrong the Country people, whom I ſhould preſſe to keepe for my Friends.</p>
               <p>This Order being come, I begun with the Country Boores, firſt, to forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Paſſages without me, and next to make Skonces and Redoubts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Towne, as alſo to repaire the Fortifications about the Caſtle, and in cleanſing of the Mote, that it might be deeper of water; the other parts alſo without me, I brought under Contribution to his Majeſtie, by ſending parties of <hi>Dragoniers</hi> athwart the Country, in <hi>Hinder Pomerne,</hi> betwixt me and <hi>Dantſicke,</hi> being twenty <hi>Dutch</hi> mile in length, which all in ſhort time I did bring under contribution to his Majeſty.

               <p>Here, I did remarke as wonderfull, that in the very moment when our ſhip did breake on ground,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> there was a <hi>Sergeants</hi> Wife a ſhipboard, who without the helpe of any women was delivered of a Boy, which all the time of the tempeſt ſhe carefully did preſerve, and being come aſhore, the next day, ſhe marched neere foure Engliſh mile, with that in her Armes, which was in her Belly the night before, and was Chriſtened the next <hi>Sunday</hi> after Sermon being the day of our thankeſgiving for our Deliverance, our Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher Mr. <hi>Murdow Mac-kenyee</hi> a worthy and Religious yong man, having diſcharged his part that day, after with much regrate did ſever from us, and followed my Lord of <hi>Rhee</hi> our Colonell unto <hi>Britaine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being thus eſcaped from danger of ſea, and from our enemies, I did keepe the Soldiers ever exerciſed in watching, in working, in parties againſt our enemies, leſt that reſting from <hi>Hoſtile</hi> employment, they ſhould become ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, immodeſt, and turbulent; and to this effect, when they were not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in parties againſt the enemies, I ſent them by parties in the Country, on <hi>Militarie</hi> execution, to bring the poſſeſſors under Contribution to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, making them hate and renounce the Emperialiſts, whom formerly they were forced to obey; ſo that by this meanes, the Country was brought into ſubjection to the King, and my Soldiers were put under as good diſcipline and command, as any ſerved his Majeſty; which diſcipline made their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinuance the longer in the ſervice: where it was rare to finde one Regiment in an Armie, that did change ſo many Officers as they did in foure yeares, as the Obſervations on their duties will cleare to the world, in deſpight of their <hi>Enviers</hi> whatſoever. But I hope no worthy ſpirit or <hi>Hereicke</hi> minde will thinke an evill thought of the vertuous.</p>
               <p>We may ſee here, that in the greateſt extremities, both Officers and Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers have greateſt need of Courage, and Reſolution: For nothing ſhould ſeeme hard to daring men, that are of courage, which never doth beget, but the opinion and cenſure of vertue. For we ſee at this time, that to dare was
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:132555:69"/>the beginning of victory, being better to hazard to ſave our ſelves and others, then to be the inſtrument to loſe us all by flying, as ſome of our Officers ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed me at our landing, to march backe to <hi>Dantſicke,</hi> which if we had, the enemy getting intelligence, he could with eaſe overtake us, and cut us all off, as he did, ſome yeeres before, cut off in the ſame Country three Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Dutch</hi> who were going to ſerve his Majeſty againſt the <hi>Pole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here alſo, I found by experience, that the ſtedfaſt, and invincible vigour of the minde riſing againſt croſſes, doth helpe much, eſpecially where neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity requireth ſuch reſolution. For being in the greateſt extremity of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, reſolving with God, I thought as my ſafeſt courſe to bide Gods ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, I ſate on the <hi>Gallerie</hi> of the ſhip, being aſſured it would be the laſt part, that would remaine together of the whole, and being ſo neere land, I was never dejected and caſt downe, nor did I doubt of our ſafe landing, ſeeing we had victuals and were in hope, the ſtorme would not continue, being in the middeſt of <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here we may ſee by this Chriſtian advertiſement, that no part of our life is exempted or freed from griefe or ſorrow: But on the contrary,

               </p>
               <p>Men of our profeſſion ought ever to be well prepared, having death ever before their Eyes, they ought to be the more familiar with <hi>God,</hi> that they might be ever ready to embrace it, not caring a ruſh for it when it came, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good while they may.

               <p>They got their firſt Anſwer againe, and then the ſervice beginnes anew on both ſides, and they begunne before night to plant their Batteries, within fourtie pace of our walles, which I thought too neere, but the night drawing on, wee reſolved with fire workes, to cauſe them remove their quarters, and their Artillerie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Having</hi> thrown ſome fiery <hi>Granades</hi> on the houſes, and ſeeing they wrought no effect, I hired a ſtout ſouldier with a Pike to reach a firye Ball I had made (upon the top of the next houſe that lay to the Caſtle) which in the end was fired, ſo that the whole ſtreet did burne right alongſt betwixt us, and the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who was then forced to retire, both his Cannon, and ſouldiers, and not without great loſſe done unto him by our ſouldiers, by meanes of the fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; where other two Officers, and eighteene of their ſouldiers were killed.</p>
               <p>The day cleering up, I fell out after with foureſcore Musketiers, and tooke thirteene Crabbats priſoners.

               <p>I being retired to the Caſtle, and the enemy marching to <hi>Colberg,</hi> having made up eighteene Dragoniers to march after the enemy for bringing me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, if his Majeſties forces from <hi>Statin</hi> were come betwixt the enemie and <hi>Colberg,</hi> my party retiring ſhewes, that the field Marſhall <hi>Guſtave Horne,</hi> and Colonell <hi>Mackey,</hi> that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded musketiers, were joyned with <hi>Kniphouſen, Bawtiſh,</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Hepburne;</hi> and were lying over-night, before a paſſage betwixt the enemy, and <hi>Colberg.</hi>

               <p>Two horſemen of <hi>Bawtiſh</hi> Regiment, that had charged through the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my came, and reported to me openly, in preſence of many ſouldiers, that the <hi>Swedens</hi> were all beaten, I being offended at the manner of their report, I cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to impriſon both the horſemen, till I knew greater certainty, and calling my ſouldiers together, I was prepared for the enemies returne. But he paſſing by a mile from us, I ſent Dragoniers to cut off his paſſage, giving them charge to cut off the Bridges, but his Dragoniers being there before mine, to be quit of their ill; my Dragoniers returned againe in ſafetie, allowing paſſage to their enemies: within few dayes after, having eſcaped this inconvenience, I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called from thence, by his Majeſties order, to joyne with the Felt-marſhall <hi>Horne,</hi> then at <hi>Griffinberg,</hi> with a party of the Armie, where before my

               <p>This Cavaliere <hi>Kniphowſen,</hi> though hee was unfortunate, he had both the Theorie and Practick befitting a Commander; whom once I did heare ſay, that one Ounce of good Fortune was to be preferred before a Pound weight of Wit; which hee knew well by his owne experience; and to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, though hee was unfortunate himſelfe, yet <hi>Cavalieres</hi> under his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, could learne by him much good order and diſcipline.</p>
               <p>And though in his life-time, hee loved not our Country-men; Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, for the love I carried to his vertues, I would not omit to make mention of his worth. No feare of danger, or death can be an excuſe to a man, to ſerve the Publique in his calling.</p>
               <p>Before I was commanded to enter this Towne, the Infection was great; yet none of us did forbeare to converſe with the Sicke, though daily exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of mortality were frequent amongſt us; for on our Watches, wee knew not the cleane from the foule; Nevertheleſſe, it behoved us all to paſſe on our duties, as wee were commanded; and though I know no reaſon for it, fewer Souldiers dyed of the infection than Burgers.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="P"/> being a reſolute fix Souldier with a Musket, as ever I commanded, dyed here of the Peſt, called <hi>Andrew Monro,</hi> who being but Eighteene yeares of age, though little of ſtature, no toyle nor travell could o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſet him; and as hee was ſtoute, ſo he was merry, and ſociable without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, ſuch another was his Cozen <hi>Iohn Monro, Kilternies</hi> grand-child, who dyed of a burning Feaver, being alive without feare before his Enemy, and of a merry and quicke diſpoſition: I made onely mention of their names, becauſe they lived vertuouſly, and dyed with farre more credit, then if they had dyed at home, where their names had never bin recorded for their worth and vertues.</p>
               <p>It is the duty of a Commander, to whom a Frontier Garriſon is put in truſt, timely to fore-ſee all wants, and defects about the place hee is truſted with, as to repaire the workes, to provide it with victuals, with powder, with Ball, Match and Armes; for it were not good hee had his materials to ſeeke, when hee is reſolved to begin his worke.</p>

               <p>Hee muſt alſo be very modeſt, and ſecret, in not revealing the dangers hee fore-ſees, but be amending of them, for feare to diſcourage others.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe wee ſee here, that it is alike with a Commander keeping a ſtrength ſometimes, as it is with a body, whereof ſome members are infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with a Canker, that to preſerve the body they muſt reſolve to loſe a member, as it was with us at this time, being forced to burne a part of the Towne, to preſerve the reſt and our ſelves; otherwiſe, all muſt have beene loſt.</p>

In remembrance of whom, I will inferre an accident happened his Majeſty of famous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, the time of his beleaguering.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty walking alone on a marriſh that was frozen, of intention with a proſpective glaſſe, to ſpie into the enemies workes, the Ice breaking his Majeſty falls up to the middle in water, being neere my Guarde, where Captaine <hi>Dumaine</hi> did command, who ſeeing his Majeſty fall in went towards him, of intention to helpe him out, which his Majeſty perceiving, leſt the enemy might take notice of them both, his Majeſty wagged his hand that the Captaine might retire, which the enemy perceiving, ſhot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a thouſand ſhot of Musket at his Majeſty, who at laſt wrought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe looſe, coming off without hurt, and ſat a while by our guarde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire.</p>
               <p>The Captaine being a bold ſpoken gentleman, well bred, and of good language, begun very familiarly to finde fault with his Majeſty, for his forwardneſſe in hazarding his Majeſties perſon in ſuch unneceſſary dangers; on whom, at that time, the eyes of all <hi>Europe</hi> were fixed, expecting their freedome and reliefes (from the tyranny of their enemies) to come from his Majeſty, and in caſe any misfortune or ſiniſter accident (as God forbid) ſhould happen unto his Majeſty, what then would become of his Majeſties confederates, and which was worſt, what would become of many brave Cavaliers of fortune, who had no further hopes then to live, and to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained under his Majeſty their Leader?</p>
               <p>His Majeſty having heard the Captaine, patiently thanked him for his good counſell, and he could not but confeſſe his owne fault, which he could not well helpe, ſeeing his minde was ſo, that he thought nothing well done which he did not himſelfe, and ſo went to dinner, where before he changed his wet clothes, in a could Tent, he called for meate, and dined groſſely, and taking a great draught of wine went and changed his clothes, and immediatly coming forth againe, while as the enemy had fallen out, as was ſaid before in the diſcharge.</p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:132555:77"/>
               <p>The time of this out-fall, our Souldiers being commanded under Major <hi>Potley</hi> to beate backe the enemy, going on ſervice, there happened a merry Accident to one of our Country-men (then Enſigne to my Colonells Company) called <hi>Iames Lyle,</hi> being in ſight of his Majeſtie, going downe a a ſteepe hill, the enemy playing hard with Cannon, the Enſigne happened to fall forwards, the winde blowing off his Periwigge, which tumbled downe the hill, the Major ſware a great oath, the poore <hi>Cavaliers</hi> head was ſhot from him, and ſeeing him riſe againe without his falſe head, ſware the Cannon had ſhot away the skinne, with the haire of his head being bald.</p>
               <p>His Majeſtie at this time alſo ſeeing a <hi>Dutch</hi> Captaines cloake about him going on ſervice, commanded to recall him, and to command out another, which was a diſgrace to the Captaine, whom his Majeſtie openly reproved, ſaying, If he had intention to have fought well, he would have felt no cold, and conſequently the carrying of his Cloake was needleſſe.</p>
               <p>In this meane time his Majeſtie looking on, from the enemies Battery a Cannon Bullet came ſo neare his Majeſtie, though he was really ſtout, he was made to ſtoope, and behinde his Majeſtie, the thigh was ſhot from a <hi>Swedens</hi> Captaine, belonging to the Artillery, who died the ſame night.</p>
               <p>Here I cannot let paſſe an overſight unworthily committed by Generall Major <hi>Kniphowſen,</hi>


                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> while as the enemy was marching out, the Guard of the Poſts being committed to the <hi>Swedens,</hi> having got command from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie to let no Officer nor Souldier come within the Towne, till the enemy was marched out; <hi>Kniphowſen</hi> preſſing in was put backe by the Captaine that commanded: Whereupon <hi>Kniphowſen</hi> not knowing what direction the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine had, or from whom, he lifting a Battoun, brake it on the Captaines head, which was evill thought of by his Majeſtie and the whole Officers of the Armie. Nevertheleſſe, we never heard of the Reparation: ſo that I would never wiſh my noble friend to lie under an affront, though done by any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne King, for if I could not be revenged, I would ſerve againſt him to be revenged, if not of him, yet at leſt of his, for which I crave pardon, having ſpoken rather like a Souldier than a Divine, for nothing ſhould divert my heart ſooner from my Superiour, than diſdaine or contempt.</p>

Therefore while time is, we ought to be diligent and carefull; for it is better to be in ſafetie through preventing, than baſely to ſuffer under our enemies, occaſion being paſt, which oft-times in warres helpes more than vertue it ſelfe; for if <hi>Knip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>howſen</hi> had embraced <hi>Tillies</hi> offer when he might, our worthy Camerades had not ſuffered as they did, which ſufferance after that made Cavaliers being freed out of priſon, to ſeeke Conditions elſe-where for their advancements, ſuch as Captaine <hi>Enuis,</hi> being firſt made Major to Colonell <hi>Monro</hi> of <hi>Obſtell,</hi> was afterward Lievetenant Colonell to the Maſter of <hi>Forbeſſe,</hi> after the death of that worthy Cavalier Sir <hi>Arthur Forbeſſe.</hi> Likewiſe Captaine <hi>William Gunne,</hi> being come out of priſon, was after advanced by Sir <hi>Patrick Ruthven,</hi> Generall Major and Governour of <hi>Ol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> though tied by Gods ordinance to live with their wives, being once ſevered and tied to ſerve, they cannot with credit quit their charge to come to their wives. The King himſelfe being once engaged in the <hi>Dutch</hi> warres, was deprived for two yeares, from the ſweete ſociety of his Queene; which ſhould teach women, and men of meaner quality, after their examples, to be patient in abſence; for more love was never betwixt two, than was betwixt his Majeſty and his Queene, no love could goe beyond their love each to others, except the love of Chriſt, God and man, towards man. For the love of this Queene, to her husband the King, did equall the love of the wife of <hi>Hieron,</hi> whom we read of in <hi>Plutarch</hi> his <hi>Apophthegmes</hi> for her rare continence and reſpect carried to her husband, ſhee never felt the breath of anothers kiſſe, but her husbands. Which in my opinion, this Queene of <hi>Sweden</hi> could well for her love to her husband have done, if it were poſſible, as is reported by <hi>Plinius</hi> of <hi>Arria,</hi> wife to <hi>Cecinna Pætus,</hi> who being condemned to die, with liberty to chooſe the forme of his death, his wife going to viſit him, did exhort him to die valiantly with great courage, and taking good night of her husband, ſhe ſtrucke herſelfe with a knife in the body, and drawing out the knife againe preſented it to <hi>Pætus</hi> her husband, with theſe words, <hi>Valnus quod ſeci Pæte, non dolet, ſed quod tu facies:</hi> as one would ſay, the wound I gave my ſelfe hurts me not, but the wound which you ſhall give grieves me. We read alſo of <hi>Portia, Cate</hi> his daughter, and wife to <hi>Brutus,</hi> who hearing of her husbands death, in deſpight of all that were about her, filled her mouth with hot burning coales, and was ſuffocated for griefe.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> than ever I did ſee in any other profeſſion, I will here yet inferre a rare example of a Souldiers wife, to encourage others to follow and imitate her vertues. The ſtory

Therefore it was well ſaid, that there were three things ſeemed pleaſant in Gods ſight, the love betwixt brethren, the friendſhip betwixt neighbours, and man and wife continuing in uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:132555:80"/>and mutuall loyalty. Who likes to reade a pleaſant ſtory to this purpoſe, let him read <hi>Nauclerus</hi> treaty of the Emperour <hi>Conrade</hi> the third, in his warres againſt <hi>Guelly</hi> Duke of <hi>Baviere,</hi> who was forced for his ſafety, to retire within <hi>Rhinesberg,</hi> where the Towne being taken by accord, by the perſwaſion of Ladies, he would grant no other condition, but that the women ſhould tranſport themſelves out of the Towne in ſafety, with ſo much as they could carry, and no more, where one taking the Duke on her backe, the reſt of the wives their husbands, the accord thus kept, and the Emperour <hi>Conrade</hi> moved to compaſſion, beholding their love and vertue, pardoned the Duke, and reſtored the Towne to their former liberties. And <hi>Bodin</hi> in the preface of his hiſtory reports that <hi>Laurence de Medices</hi> was healed of a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous diſeaſe, by reading of this ſtory without any other helpe; I wiſh it may worke the ſame effect upon all thoſe that reade it, eſpecially the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male ſex, in making them follow the vertuous examples of theſe noble Ladies, in loving their husbands beyond all other things whatſoever, and thoſe that will not be moved thereto, I wiſh them the death of that <hi>Roman</hi> Lady, reported of by <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi> and <hi>Titus Livius,</hi>


                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Q"/> called <hi>Publia Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelia Annea,</hi> who lived twenty yeares without once offending of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and ſeeing him die, contracted ſuch griefe for his death, that ſhe threw herſelfe into the grave with her husband, where ſhe died, and lay with him. This wiſh I hope cannot be taken in ill part by the vertuous La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; that are like <hi>Cornelia:</hi> but I feare there is none ſuch at all. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude then this point of my obſervation; in my judgment, no women are more faithfull, more chaſt, more loving, more obedient nor more devour, then Souldiers wives, as daily experience doth witneſſe, and none have more reaſon to be ſo, then ſome of them, whoſe husbands doe daily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe all dangers of body for their ſakes, not fearing death it ſelfe, to relieve and keepe them from dangers. To th'end you may ſee, that the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble parts and vertues before mentioned, are not proper alone unto the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine ſex, I will here inferre ſome notable examples of the good will, love and faithfullneſſe of husbands to their wives, eſpecially Souldiers, whereof amongſt many, for the preſent, I will, to content the Reader, mention two or three, that are notable, whereof one happened at this time in our warfare, worthy to be recorded, of that noble, valorous, pious and worthy Cavalier, the Felt-marſhall <hi>Guſtave Horne;</hi>

Another example we reade in the ſtory written by <hi>Plinie</hi> &amp; <hi>Valerius Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> that is very notable to this purpoſe. <hi>Sempronius Gracchus,</hi> finding two ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents coming out of his bed, enquired of <hi>Theologues</hi> what might that acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent preſage? they anſwered, that if he killed the ſhe ſerpent, his wife ſhould die, and if he killed the he ſerpent, he ſhould die himſelfe; he loved his wife <hi>Cornelia</hi> ſo dearely that he commanded to kill the he ſerpent, and ſhortly after he himſelfe died. Alſo that which we reade of <hi>Meleager</hi> ſonne to <hi>Danneus</hi> is notable, who would not riſe out of his chaire, for the reliefe of the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:132555:81"/>Towne he was in,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="S"/> for his father, mother, brethren, or ſiſters, all crying and calling for his helpe, who nothing cared for their ruine: but how ſoone <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra</hi> his wife came to him, deſiring his helpe, and telling him, the enemy was alreadie entred the Towne, and was ſetting the houſes on fire; this ſtony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted man, who before could be moved by nothing, at the deſire of his wife, went to Armes againſt the enemy, and repulſing them backe, ſaved the Towne from wracke and ruine, and the Citizens from death: for this <hi>Melea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> (as all honeſt men ought to doe) eſteemed his wife and himſelfe but one; ſo that he could deny her nothing. Here it may be, ſome will alleage, he was <hi>Iohn Thomſons</hi> man. I anſwer, it was all one, if ſhee was good: for all ſtories eſteeme them happie, that can live together man and wife without contention, ſtrife, or jarres, and ſo doe I. And, in my opinion, no wife can be ill, that wants the gall; for the gall in the body is the ſeate of choler, from which the love of man and wife ſhould be free, and as of gall, ſo of deſpite, of anger and of bitterneſſe.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Y"/> as I was credibly informed, being accompanied with Lievenant <hi>George Heatly,</hi> being both reſolute and ſtout, were the firſt that came over the walles with ladders, who at their firſt entry having but a few Musketiers with them, they were charged on the ſtreets by the enemies Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſiers, or beſt horſemen, where they were forced to ſtand cloſe, their backs to the wall where they entred, and to give ſeverall Salves of Muskets upon the enemy, till they were made to retire.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe after we were entred, the yellow and the blew Briggads, being eſteemed of all the Army both reſolute and couragious in all their exploits; they were to enter on the <hi>Iriſh</hi> quarter, where they were twice with great loſſe furiouſly beaten off, and were cruelly ſpoyled with fire-workes throwne by the <hi>Iriſh</hi> amongſt them. But at laſt they having entred, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the inequality of their ſtrength, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> though weake ſtood to it, and fought with ſword, and pikes within workes a long time, till the moſt part of the Souldiers fell to ground, where they ſtoode fighting, ſo that in the end, Lievetenant Colonell <hi>Walter Butler,</hi> who commanded the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> being ſhot in the arme, and pierced with a pike through the thigh, was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken priſoner, ſo that the next day, it was to be ſeene on the poaſt where the beſt ſervice was done: and truely had all the reſt ſtood ſo well to it, as the <hi>Iriſh</hi> did, we had returned with great loſſe, and without victory.</p>
               <p>The fury paſt, the whole ſtreete being full of Coaches and ruſty waggons richly furniſhed withall ſorts of riches, as Plate, Iewells, Gold, Money, Clothes, Mulets and horſes for ſaddle, coach and waggons, whereof all men that were careleſſe of their dueties, were too carefull in making of booty, that I did never ſee Officers leſſe obeyed, and reſpected than here for a time, till the hight of the market was paſt: and well I know, ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments had not one man with their Colours, till the fury was paſt, and ſome Colours were loſt the whole night, till they were reſtored the next day, ſuch diſorder was amongſt us, all occaſioned through covetouſneſſe, the roote of all evill and diſhoneſty.</p>
               <p>At laſt the execution paſt, his Majeſty entred himſelfe, being guarded with the <hi>Rhine-Grave,</hi> and his horſemen, who immediatly were comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to croſſe the bridge, and to follow the enemy at their heeles, being on flight towards <hi>Glogoe,</hi> where the Felt-marſhall <hi>Tuffenbacke,</hi> the Count of <hi>Schonberg,</hi> and Mounte <hi>De Cuculé</hi> had retired with ſuch as eſcaped.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty having but ſcarce quartered in the Towne, the fire begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to burne the City accidentally; Orders were given with ſtroake of Drume with a Bancke beaten in all ſtreetes, that all Officers and Souldiers, under paine of death, ſhould repaire preſently to their Colours, on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide of the Oder, in the outer workes, where Sr. <hi>Iohn Hepburne</hi> was ordained to command within the workes, except ſuch as were appointed to guard the Portes of the Towne, his Majeſties quarter and the Generalls lodging on the market place, where a ſtrong guard was kept to ſuppreſſe plundering, and the inſolency of Souldiers. Nevertheleſſe theſe orders proclaimed and publiſhed, many diſobeyed remaining in the Towne for plundering.</p>
               <p>In this conflict, the enemy loſt neere three thouſand men, beſides the Officers that were killed <hi>(viz.)</hi> foure Colonells, <hi>Herbenſtine, Heydo, Wale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> and <hi>Ioure,</hi> and above thirty ſix Officers were killed.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe there were taken priſoners, Colonell <hi>Sparre</hi> with five Lievete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:132555:83"/>Colonell of <hi>Dutch</hi> and one <hi>Iriſh</hi> Cavalier, that behaved himſelfe both honourably and well; Colours alſo they did loſe, as I did ſee the next day made Counte of before Generall <hi>Bannier,</hi> forty one, and Cornets of horſe nine.</p>
               <p>On our ſide were loſt alſo at leaſt eight hundred men, whereof the blew and yellow, for their parts, loſt five hundred.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty alſo did get here a great deale of proviſion for the Army, as Corne, Amunition, and eighteene peeces of Ordinance.</p>
               <p>The next day his Majeſty appointed Generall Major <hi>Leſly</hi> as Governor over the Towne, giving him orders to repaire the ruinous workes, and walles, as alſo orders were given for burying of the dead, which were not buried fully in ſix dayes,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Z"/> in th'end they were caſt by heapes in great dit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, above a hundred in every Grave.</p>
               <p>The next day we were ordained to aſſemble our Regiments, and to bring them together in Armes, that they might be provided of what they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of Armes, having loſt many in their diſorder.</p>

               <head>The eighth Obſervation.</head>
               <p>HIS Majeſty going to rancounter his enemy, before his riſing from his Royall Leager at <hi>Swede,</hi> did wiſely diſpoſe of his Army, in making it into Briggads, that coming unto the action, he ſhould not neede to thinke on the <hi>Theorie,</hi> when it were time to practiſe, as many young Commanders are forced to doe, beginning to learne of others, that which is defective in themſelves, who are to be pittied, that undertake to leade others being ignorant themſelves: but this wiſe Generall, at this time, did not only order his Army,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="&amp;."/> as he would have them to ſtand in Battaile, but alſo knowing the gifts, and ſeverall parts, his chiefe Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the field were indued with, he diſpoſeth of them, in appointing ſuch places for them, in fighting againſt their enemies, as did beſt befit their vertues, which all he knew before hand, partly by his owne experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and partly, by enquiring of others, their qualities and vertues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secundo,</hi> his Majeſty doth forecaſt with himſelfe, what the enemy, being ſtrong might intend againſt him, and accordingly, he fore-ſaw wiſely how to prevent him, in dividing his Army, by ſending the Felt-marſhall on the one ſide of the <hi>Oder</hi> with a part of his Army, going himſelfe on the other, leaving the bridge and paſſage at <hi>Swede</hi> well fortified and beſet with Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to the end, that which of both Armies might be conſtrained to retire o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the bridge, being ſafe might then conveniently joyne with the other.</p>
               <p>As his Majeſty was wiſe in fore-ſeeing what might happen, he was alſo diligent, in taking time of his enemies on the ſudden, before they could come together; ſo that after this victory obtained, his Majeſty did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly get elbow roome by the enemies removing over the <hi>Elve</hi> and the <hi>Oder;</hi> but alſo he did gaine time to ſettle his affaires with the Princes; for thoſe who would not before this victory, ſcarce keepe correſpondence with his Majeſty, afterwards his Majeſty having freed their country from their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, they were then content to intreate for his friendſhip, by their Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, and he like to a cunning gamſter, taking the Ball at the right re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, embraced their friendſhip, and confederacy, having bound them
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:132555:84"/>up, in a more ſtrict manner then before, till in th'end, they were forced to dance after his pipe.</p>
               <p>Here likewiſe I did obſerve, that it is never good, to truſt too much unto our owne ſtrength,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> as our enemies did, who at their banqueting, and <hi>inter po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula,</hi> before that the ſtorme went on, though hearing the noyſe of our Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, they fell a laughing, as wondring what the <hi>Swedens</hi> meant, thought they to fly over the walles, and granting he could enter, were they not ſo ſtrong as he? Many more idle diſcourſes they had, extolling themſelves in their pride, boaſting of their ſtrength and courage, not ſetting God before them, they diſdained and contemned their enemies, but ſuddenly in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant they found their owne follies, being brought unto feare and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo that at laſt, their wits confounded, and conſequently their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons confuſed, and their enemies, though weake inſtruments, by the power of the God of Armies were made ſtrong and couragious, for puniſhing them in repaying of their former Barbarity, and cruelty uſed by them at new <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburg,</hi> where we ſee, the lord repayeth their wickedneſſe, when they leaſt expected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tiffenbacke,</hi> the Felt-marſhall was much to blame for his command, being ſo ſtrong within the Towne as we were without, that he did not adventure to fight us in the fields, or at leaſt, to have tried our conduct and valour, with a ſtrong party: his not daring to adventure with us made us the more couragious and reſolute to ſeeke him, though with diſadvantage, having once found him to be a timorous enemy, keeping himſelfe cloſe within walles, for we know well, the greater his ſtrength was within, if once we entred, his confuſion would be the greater: for a multitude within a ſtrength eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially horſemen, many ſervants and baggage breede ever confuſion, for avoiding whereof, the Governour had the more reaſon to have tried us in the fields; whereby he had encouraged his Garriſon, who ſeeing he durſt adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to meete us without, being retired, they would not be afraid within walles.</p>
               <p>So it is never good to reſolve to be alwayes the defender, but rather ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the time,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and circumſtances, ſometimes to try Fortune, as well by purſuing, as by defending, that our credit may not be called in queſtion, neither for too much ſlowneſſe, nor for too much forwardneſſe, but ſtill to preſſe for the Medioerity, being the true vertue of Fortitude, without which no Souldier can attaine commendation, if he doe participate of either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames, as this Felt-marſhall did, ſtaying within walles. Yet ſome, I know will object, that I ought rather to praiſe the actions of the enemy, to make ours the more glorious, to which I anſwer, ours at all times, as here, were ſo ſplendid, that no Luſtre could be added unto them, our Leader <hi>Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtavus</hi> being <hi>Illuſtriſsimus</hi> himſelfe, and the favourite of Fortune, to whom all things ſucceeded fortunatly by taking of time, the moſt pretious of all things, eſpecially in warres, which ſometimes helpes as much as vertue it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>The forwardneſſe and courage of Major <hi>Iohn Sinclaire,</hi> and of his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league, Lievetenant <hi>Heatlie,</hi> is not to be over-paſt, they being the firſt gave good example to enter this Towne, in going over the walles with ladders, with a weake party of fifty musketiers, that ventured to follow them, which were hardly received by the enemies horſemen, nevertheleſſe they valo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly defended themſelves, and made their enemies to retire with loſſe, ſo
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:132555:84"/>that, as my intention here, is not to over-praiſe my friends vertue, I would not on the other part be filent in giving them their due, anſwerable to their merits, and no more.</p>
               <p>We ſee alſo by experience dayly, that at all times, as here, no man e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſerved God for nought, who rewardeth men, though not through me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in reſpect of his God-head, of whom we can merit nothing, yet of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit bounty is ever ready to reward them truely that doe ſerve him: his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty with his Army having ſerved God in the morning, at night he was made victorious over his enemies.</p>
               <p>And that his Majeſty in the afternoone on the Sabboth purſued his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, there was a neceſſity in it:


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Generall <hi>Tillies</hi> Army being on their march for the reliefe of the Towne, his Majeſty was forced to take the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of time, which once being paſt doth never returne.</p>
               <p>Here we may ſee the evill, that ſeare bringeth within a City or Strength cauſing diſorder and confuſion, but if all thoſe within this Towne had ſtood to their defence, as Lievetenant Colonell <hi>Butler</hi> did and the <hi>Iriſh, Francford</hi> had not bin taken.</p>
               <p>Therefore, when reſiſtance is not made, as it ought to be, the victory is eaſily attained: for nothing encourageth more, then good example, <hi>Et contra.</hi> And I did obſerve here, that no nation eſteemed good Souldiers, are inferiour to the <hi>Dutch</hi> in maintaining a ſtorme, or in extremity of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, they being otherwiſe good Souldiers for obedience to command, in watches, marches, working about workes, and in doing all other dueties befitting their profeſſion, being in company of others.</p>
               <p>Pike-men being reſolute men, ſhall be ever my choyce in going on exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, as alſo in retiring honourably with diſadvantage from an enemy, eſpecially againſt horſemen: and we ſee oftimes, as we found here, that when musketiers doe disbandon, of greedineſſe to make booty, the worthy pike-men remaine ſtanding firme with their Officers, guarding them and their Colours, as being worthy the glorious name of brave Souldiers, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring vertue before the love of gold, that vaniſheth while vertue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth.</p>
               <p>This vice of avarice is alike common to the ſuperiour Officer,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and to the inferiour Souldier, which oftimes makes the ſuperiour to be deſpiſed as well by the common Souldier, as by his betters: And therefore publique imployments of command ſhould never be given to ſuch greedy perſons; for as ſparing in a private perſon is commendable, being done without hurt to another; even ſo the vertue of liberality is due to him that is publiquely imployed: as alſo he ought to have ſplendor in his carriage, and not to give evill example to others his inferiours, if once he be honoured with command in leading of others. I muſt then againe condemne this kinde of avarice, that makes men for booty abandon their Colours and their duety, they being the cauſe of times of the overthrow of their worthy Camerades ſtanding to fight, when they were employed in making of booty, for which many time, they are contemned, and their money taken from them by the multitude, with diſgrace and danger of their lives: for though ſometimes they make booty, they have not the fortune to enjoy it one quarter of an houre, thanking God to be rid of it with their lives, though not with their credits.</p>
               <p>It is the duety of valiant Commanders, and of brave Souldiers, when
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:132555:85"/>ever fire entreth into a City, ſtrength or Leager, ſuddenly with their Armes to repaire to their Colours, leſt at ſuch times, the enemy being neere hand ſhould be ready to take advantage: but here the baſer ſort of Souldiers, neither for obedience to his Majeſties command, nor for love of their Officers, nor of their owne credits, would ſtirre to attend their Colours, though the enemy had ſhewed himſelfe to purſue the City.</p>
               <p>Here alſo, the enemy was to blame, for leaving proviſion and Amuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion behinde them, whoſe duety it was rather to deſtroy it by fire or water, then to leave it to their enemies. But we ſee, there is no counſell againſt the Lord invented by man, able to worke, bleſſed be his name for ever.</p>

               <p>The eight of Aprill, we lay downe before a skonce royall, built on a ſtrong paſſe, betwixt us and the Towne. This skonce well fortified was well provided of Cannon; It had alſo a wide Graffe of running water, and a draw-bridge, which was taken up at our coming, and then they diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their Cannon on us; where at firſt there were killed ſome ſix Souldiers: the night drawing on, our watches ſet forth, I was appointed by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to be Captaine of the watch, being ordained to overſee the making of the Batteries: As alſo I was commanded to ſet forwards our workes, both for intrenching, and for running our lines of approach to the skonce, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I was ſo buſied, that the whole night I went never off my feete, but

But no excuſe, though true, would mitigate his paſſion, till he had firſt conſidered on the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and then he was ſorry he had offended me without reaſon.

               <p>His Majeſtie on the Sabbath day in the afternoone ſuffered the principall Officers of his Armie (ſuch as Generall <hi>Banier,</hi> and Lievetenant Generall <hi>Bawtis,</hi> and divers others) to make merry, though his Majeſtie did drinke none himſelfe; for his cuſtome was never to drinke much, but very ſeldome, and upon very rare conſiderations, where ſure he had ſome other plot to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuate, that concerned his advancement, and the weale of his State.</p>

               <p>THis Towne of <hi>Lanſberg</hi> being a Frontier Garriſon lying neare the borders of <hi>Pole</hi> on the <hi>Wert,</hi> the having of it made <hi>Pomeren</hi> ſure, and the <hi>Marke,</hi> giving unto his Majeſtie the freer paſſage unto <hi>Sileſia;</hi> and therefore it was that his Majeſtie did uſe the greater diligence and celeritie in obtaining of it, with as great honour and reputation, as could be imagined, in reſpect of the inequalitie of ſtrength betwixt us and our enemies: As alſo in conſideration of the ſituation of the place, being on the one ſide fortified
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:132555:86"/>by nature, yet beyond nature and probabilitie of reaſon. This ſtrong Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was forced to yeeld to <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> who was <hi>Mars</hi> his Minion,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> and Fortunes Favourite, or rather their Maſter, as we ſee by his frequent Victories obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt his enemies, who, though ſtrongeſt, are made to ſubmit to the weakeſt partie, where we may ſee, that as induſtry is fruitfull, ſo there is a kinde of a good Angell, as it were waiting ever upon diligence, carrying a Lawrell in his hand, to crowne her. And therefore it was, that they ſaid of old, that Fortune ſhould not be prayd unto, but with hands in motion, which made this valiant King love ever to be buſied in vertues exerciſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting a Generall, that carried a minde as this Invincible King did, while he lived, ſtill riſing to bleſſedneſſe and contentation.</p>
               <p>It is commonly ſeene, that thoſe who feare leaſt are commonly overcome, as became of <hi>Francford</hi> on the <hi>Oder,</hi> and this Towne alſo: and though victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry we ſee be from God, yet to overcome an enemy, the courage and skill of Commanders is very requiſit and neceſſary.


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> And where good military diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline is obſerved, as was done here; there confidence doth ariſe, perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding us, we can doe what we pleaſe. Of this opinion was our Leader, and our Armie never doubted of their owne valour, nor of their Leaders good Conduct, which made our Victories the eaſier to be gotten.</p>
               <p>Here alſo we ſee the goodneſſe of intelligence; for had his Majeſtie not gotten the Black-ſmith, or ſome other like unto him, to have beene intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencer and guide to winne through the ſhallow Trinkets he led us, to the Damme upon the head of their Watch, who were ſurprized; hardly could we have overcome this Towne, on ſuch a ſudden, for without this good of intelligence, which is ſo neceſſary, and of ſo great a moment in warres, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or very little can be effectuated in unknowne places. For good Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencers are ſo requiſit in an Armie, that no meanes ought to beſpared on them, providing they be truſtie: for one deſigne or ſecret of our enemies well knowne, may bring all the reſt we deſire to a wiſhed end, or at leaſt, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve us and ours from danger. This Black-ſmith, that was our guide in lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding us towards our enemy, at our firſt on-going on ſervice, the enemy play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hard with Muskets, nevertheleſſe he went on without feare, under-ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king alike danger with our ſelves, but finding in time of hot ſervice ſome fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling beſides him, our powder being a little wet, and not giving ſo good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port as the enemies did, he then ſaid, he would returne to his Majeſtie, and ſend us better powder, yet I thinke, though here there did appeare ſome lacke of conſtant reſolution in him, that time, exerciſe, and frequency of danger would make him a brave fellow, being of a ſtrong and a good able body, but in my opinion, the ſtouteſt of men, till they be a little acquainted with the furious noiſe of the Cannon, will naturally feare and ſtoope at the firſt.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe his Majeſtie was to be commended for his diligence by night and by day, in ſetting forwards his workes; for he was ever out of patience, till once they were done, that he might ſee his Souldiers ſecured and guarded from their enemies; for when he was weakeſt, he digged moſt in the ground; for in one yeare what at <hi>Swede, Francford, Landsberg, Brandenburg, Verbum, Tannermonde, Wittenberg,</hi> and <hi>Wirtzburg,</hi> he cauſed his Souldiers to worke more for nothing, than the States of <hi>Holland</hi> could get wrought in three yeares, though they ſhould beſtow every yeare a Tunne of gold: and this he did, not onely to ſecure his Souldiers from the enemy, but alſo to keepe them from idleneſſe. When they were not employed on ſervice, they were
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:132555:87"/>kept by good diſcipline in awe and obedience, and that with as great mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, love and diſcretion as could be.</p>
               <p>And his Majeſtie knew well,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> that our Nation was of that nature, that they could take to heart the auſtere carriage of their Commanders, were they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo good. For while as ſometimes, through his Majeſties impatiencie, he would cauſe to impriſon ſome of our Country-men, without ſolicitation, his Majeſtie was ever the firſt did minde their liberties; for he knew their ſtomacks were ſo great, that they would burſt or ſtarve in priſon, before they would acknowledge an errour committed againſt their Maſter, except it were of negligence.</p>
               <p>Moreover, nothing can more diſcourage a Citie, Fort, or Strength, that is beleaguered, than when they ſee their ſecrets diſcovered, and their paſſages from reliefe cut off; as it was ſeene of thoſe that yeelded up the Skonce to Sir <hi>Iohn Hepburne,</hi> being contented to come in the Colonells mercy, ſeeing themſelves barred from all reliefe.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe the dutie of Leaders,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> that lead men on ſervice, ought to be limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with diſcretion, and not to advance further than with conveniency they may retire againe, if need be, leſt by too farre advancing, they not onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger themſelves, but alſo ingage others, for their reliefes, to indanger all: and a fault committed in this kinde, through too much forwardneſſe, merits a harder cenſure, than remiſſeneſſe with diſcretion, ſeeing in the latter, a man is but cenſured alone, but committing the former errour, he loſeth himſelfe and others.</p>
               <p>Here alſo we found by experience, that the ſpade and the ſhovell are ever good companions in danger, without which, we had loſt the greateſt part of our followers. Therefore in all occaſions of ſervice, a little advantage of ground is ever profitable againſt horſe, foote, or Cannon. And for this it was, that the beſt Commanders made ever moſt uſe of the ſpade and the ſhovell, and that in ſuch ground as was found moſt commodious for their ſafeties.</p>
               <p>We ſee alſo here his Majeſties diſpoſition in entertaining his Officers kindly after victory, eſteeming them not as ſervants, but as companions in his mirth, as a wiſe Maſter ought and ſhould doe to thoſe he findes obedient to his Commandements, incouraging them another time to undergoe any ſervice or danger for his ſake, that was ſo kinde and familiar with them, joyning their hearts as well with his love, as with his bountie; for he knew well nothing was more able to bring victory next under God, than good Commanders: As alſo his Majeſtie knew, that to be courteous unto his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers was the way to triumph over his enemies.</p>

               <p>HIS Majeſty could never be aſſured of the Princes friendſhip, till firſt he had forced their enemies to give ground, being made to leave behind them <hi>Pomeren Maclenburg,</hi> and the three markes of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> without any Emperiall Garriſon, except one was left in <hi>Grip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwald,</hi> but ſo ſoone as the Duke of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> did ſee the enemy retiring, and his Majeſty prevailing; he then begun to enter in treaty, and to give his Majeſty aſſurance of his loyall friendſhip, by ſubſcribing of certaine Articles condeſcended upon betwixt them, at <hi>Barleene</hi> in Iune 1631.</p>
               <p>On this march, though ſhort, we had many variable reſolutions and changes, which wëre cauſed by the changable accidents happening in the courſe of this warre, which made his Majeſties reſolutions to vary, as the time changed, ſometimes through feare of his ſtrong enemy, ſometimes by ſuſpecting the Princes, who were alſo affrighted and feared, being aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in their mindes, they were not able to diſcerne what was moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for them, ſo that their doubting and feare ſuffered them not to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard any notable thing, in aſſiſting his Majeſty againſt their common enemy; but ſtill lingred to joyne with his Majeſty, expecting the enemy would prevaile, and then they would joyne with the Maſter of the fields, as ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily is done over all <hi>Dutchland</hi> in all degrees, from the higheſt to the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, they wagge as the buſh doth reſolving ever to quit their beſt friends in adverſity.</p>
               <p>Here we ſee the inconſtancy of the Dukes friendſhip, that will not be friends as well in adverſity, as in proſperity: for when fortune favours us; all the world would ſeme to laugh on us;


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="N"/> but when we are but once kik'tin the heele with any malignant chance of misfortune, then our ſuppoſed friends fly from us, at a farre diſtance, while they ſee us like to be toſſed by the Tempeſt of adverſity.

               <head>The twelfth Obſervation.</head>
               <p>AT this time I did remarke the great, wonderfull, rare and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary mercy of God towards our Leader the Kings Majeſty, and his Royall little Army, which, before our removing from old <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> was much infected with the plague of Peſtilence, ſo that we knew not the ſicke from the whole: for of our Regiment alone,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Y"/> there died in one weeke, above thirty Souldiers, and being but removed ſix dayes, at our downe-lying at <hi>Werben,</hi> we ſcarce knew there was any infection amongſt us, ſo that in a moneths time, we were miraculouſly rid of it, and for mine owne part, I neither know, nor can conjecture any reaſon for it (cheifely being in the dogge dayes, and in a Leaguer) but the Lords mercy towards his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and his Army, being at this time, farre inferiour in ſtrength to our enemies.</p>
               <p>Many examples and teſtimonies of Gods favour towards his Majeſty I did obſerve on this march: for ſuch terror was put in their hearts, by his Majeſties victory obtained at <hi>Francford</hi> and <hi>Lansberg,</hi> that they fled, where once they did heare of our coming, being perſwaded and informed by their conſciences, that, if his Majeſty were victorious, they ſhould get no better
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:132555:91"/>quarters, then were given by them at <hi>Madeburg,</hi> which made them quit ſtrong Garriſons, before they would attend or abide the danger.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we may plunly conclude,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Z"/> that they doe not merit the name of Souldiers, nor yet the title of couragious Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manders, that did ſuccumbe before they ſaw or felt the dinte of their enemies valour. Fie then on ſuch Commanders! If they were of my friends, I would allow them a Pinne higher on the Gallowes, then is allowed for common offences: for ſuch Cullions that quit places for feare, not ſeeing their enemies, are unworthy the name of Souldiers; but I thinke they were too rich, and conſequently, they grew too feeble.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe here I did rejoyce, and was glad, when I did obſerve that it is not, nor was not peculiar to any ſtill to have overcome, or to be victorious: the Emperialiſts, I know by experience, and ſo did the Regiment I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, had their time of the victory againſt the King of <hi>Deamarke</hi> (where I did learne to make a retreate) but now being come under another Leader, there Fortune began to change and to retire from us, we learning under the invincible <hi>Gustavus,</hi> to advance orderly, never falling off, but ever keeping faces to our enemy, a brave leſſon learned from a brave Commander. So that we ſee here, victory keepes no conſtant dwelling, being now here, now there, yet we ſee, that it is beſt kept with counſell and vertue, neither can I thinke, but fortune, and chance hath a great hand in it, for it is a greater matter to uſe victory well, then to overcome, and all victors have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiable deſire of their proſperous fortune, never appointing an end to their deſires; And nothing brings victory more, next unto God, then good Commanders, whereof King <hi>Guſtavus</hi> the invincible had many.</p>
               <p>Here alſo at the intaking of <hi>Hagleberg,</hi> Generall <hi>Bannier</hi> did well in giving the Souldiers ſome liberty of booty: to the end they might prove the more reſolute another time, for Souldiers will not refuſe to undergoe any hazard, when they ſee their Officers willing to reward them with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and profit.</p>

               <p>ABout the middeſt of Iuly 1631 his Majeſties forces being come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of Horſe and Foote, he did reſolve to ſet downe his Leaguer at <hi>Werben</hi> on the <hi>Elve,</hi> where the River of the <hi>Haggle</hi> enters into it, and ſpying a parcell of ground, the moſt commodious that could be had, for ſituation, and aire, having firſt the commodity of tranſportation by water, on the River of the <hi>Haggle</hi> running into the <hi>Elve</hi> at the Leaguer, whereon all proviſions could be brought for maintaining of his Army; He had alſo the whole country on the other ſide of the <hi>Elve,</hi> behinde him as his friends.</p>
               <p>This Leaguer lay along the ſide of the River on a plaine meadow, being
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:132555:91"/>guarded by the River on one ſide, and the foreſide was guarded by a long ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Dike, which of old was made to hold off the River from the Land, which Dike his Majeſtie made uſe of, dividing it by Skonces and Redoubts, which defended one another with Flanckering, having Batteries and Cannon ſet within them, alongſt the whole Leaguer: he did alſo ſet over the River a Ship-bridge, for his Retreate in neede, as alſo for bringing commodiouſly of proviſion and ſuccours, from the Country, and Garriſons on the other ſide, as <hi>Hagleberg, Ratene, Perleberg,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>In like manner his Majeſtie did fortifie the Towne of <hi>Werben</hi> for his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazin,</hi> being cloſe to the Leaguer, with workes about it, which defended the Leaguer, and the Leaguer-workes were made to defend the Towne alſo, ſo that they could relieve one another being in moſt diſtreſſe, and both the Towne-wall and Leaguer-wall, were ſo thicke and firme of old earth, faced up with new, that no Cartow could enter into it. The Bulwarkes on which the Batteries were made for the Cannon, were alſo very ſtrong and formally built, and they flanckered one another, ſo that none could finde but folly in preſſing to enter by ſtorme; And betwixt the flanckerens were left voides, for letting Troopes of horſe in and out, with ſlawght Bommes before them, where ſtrong guards were kept for defending the paſſage.</p>
               <p>And on the one ſide of this Leaguer were planted above one hundred and

               <p>The manner we were ordained to watch this Leaguer, every Briggad of foote had ſuch a portion of the Leaguer appointed for them to watch and maintaine by fight, in caſe of a ſtorme, which part they had fortified them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and Briggads of horſe were ordained to attend particularly on a foote Briggad, to ſecond them, if that the enemy, at a ſtorme, ſhould beate the foot backe from their Poaſts, then the horſe Briggad was ready to charge, till the foote might be recollected by the diligence and valour of their Officers: for beſides the watch ordinary on the Poaſts, the whole Briggads of foote ſtood in readineſſe at all Alarums behinde the guard, and the horſe Briggads did ſtand in Battaile behinde them. Likewiſe without the Leaguer, there were ſquadrons of our horſemen to ſtand in readineſſe at one end, that while as the enemies foote ſhould march on to the ſtorme, our horſemen might charge through to the end of the Leaguer, where they were to be received againe within the Leaguer, being hardly followed, ſo that the judicious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der can eaſily judge, what a difficultie it was to ſtorme ſuch a Leaguer.</p>
               <p>Being thus provided to welcome our enemy, his Majeſtie hearing of his enemies neere approach with a ſtrong Armie, his Majeſtie did reſolve like a wiſe Generall to try his enemies courage in the Field, before they ſhould come neare to diſcourage his little Armie.

Our dutie was to be the more ſtrict, having received command of his Majeſtie, not to quit that ground, except the enemy by greatneſſe of ſtrength, would beate me from it, and then I ſhould retire orderly skirmiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the enemy, our faces to them ſtill, and our Armes, giving fire on them till we came under our walles, ſo that, by that meanes the Leaguer would get time to be in readineſſe to receive them.</p>

               <p>HIS Majeſtie wiſely made choice of a fit place for his Leaguer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing commodious for tranſportation of victualls unto his Armie, without being in danger of his enemies.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/>
                  <hi>Homo homini quid interest:</hi> for we finde a great difference betwixt his Majeſties welcoming of <hi>Tilly</hi> to <hi>Werben,</hi> and the Felt-marſhall <hi>Twifenbacke</hi> his welcome made to his Majeſtie before <hi>Francford</hi> on the <hi>Oder;</hi> who never did preſent himſelfe in the Fields, though almoſt as ſtrong as we were: but here we finde the contrary, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of <hi>Tillies</hi> ſtrength, being twenty-ſix thouſand men, <hi>Guſtavus</hi> was not afraid to have invaded his fore-Troopes with a weake partie, and did defeate them; ſhewing unto us the difference betwixt Commanders, by his owne valourous example, incouraging his little Armie before the enemies coming; he would not firſt meete his enemy with an Army, but having ſtrengthened his Leaguer with <hi>Baniers</hi> Forces, and called in his weake Garriſons from danger, and then taking all victualls out of his enemies way, bringing it within his Leaguer, he then armed with courage and reſolution, adventures to Rancounter his enemy with a partie, and having tryed them to their loſſe, he retired againe with credit, preparing his Leaguer, being ſtrongly beſet with men, Amunition and victualls, he was not afraid to be taken unawares, as the <hi>French</hi> were within <hi>Philopſburg,</hi> not being provided to oppoſe their enemies, for their ſloath they were cruelly muichered. Teaching others, by their examples, not to truſt too much in ſecuritie, be the place never ſo ſtrong, if they be left unto themſelves, and grow careleſſe, they muſt needs ſuffer under the Tyranny of their enemies.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe his Majeſtie, not truſting to his owne wiſedome, he did call his chiefe Officers to Counſell, asking them, what was to be done (as wiſe Commanders ought to doe) and finding them all by ſilence to relie on his Majeſties will, giving Orders for all things that were to be done before their coming, he reſolved to ſtand to it, being truely couragious, as he did not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture raſhly, without asking his Officers advice, knowing once their reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution agreeable to his owne, he was not inconſiderately afraid of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſtrength, though mightie and ſtrong, neither was he unprovided againſt their coming.</p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:132555:94"/>
               <p>His Majeſties dexteritie of Command is ſeene here, by the order of his diſcipline, in giving good orders for watching: Firſt he divided the Poſtes, and appointed what footmen or Briggad ſhould watch on the ſeverall Poſts, as they were ſeverally fortified by themſelves, to the end, no man might blame their owne worke, for inſufficiency to hold out the enemy. As alſo he appointed ſeverall Briggads of horſe to ſecond the Poſtes ſeverally, every one knowing where to repaire in time of ſervice: As alſo he did inſtruct them of the manner they were to fight, in reſiſting the enemies entry: As alſo in caſe of their entry, he did inſtruct both foote and horſe, how and in what manner they ſhould be repulſed againe, promiſing, according to his wonted Cuſtome, to be a Companion both of their travells and dangers, and that he ſhould never leave them, till firſt they ſhould quit him, and that he would promiſe as he was a Royall King.</p>
               <p>A worthy ſaying of a worthy King and Generall, whoſe prudence and wiſedome in Command,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> was ever anſwerable to the dignitie of his maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticke perſon, that ought and ſhould be endued with infinite vertues, ſince in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite were thoſe things he had to foreſee, and which are needfull for a man of his place. Infinite chances, and altogether divers, every moment were ſet before him, in ſo much, that <hi>Arges Eyes</hi> were too few for him, not onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the weight of his Command, but alſo in reſpect of the wit and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which was requiſit for him.</p>
               <p>All other commands belonging to a Souldier are ſo inferiour to this of a Generall, that almoſt they are nothing in reſpect of this, who amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers his great gifts, he muſt know ſeverly to command, and ſoftly to beare with others. As alſo, he muſt learne patiently to give place to others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacy, and he muſt not onely be powerfull to ſtrengthen for his owne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, but alſo he muſt weaken his enemies, and chiefely, he muſt make warre by policy, without giving battell, or travell (as this wiſe Generall did deale twice with old <hi>Tillie</hi>) who was forced after a long march, having but viſited him, and ſeene his orders, to retire againe, with the loſſe of many men, without any detriment or hurt at all to his Majeſties owne litle Army, which he kept ever to the beſt, by preſerving them from their enemies, and by ſupplying of them, as they became weake, ſo that their weakneſſe could never be truly diſcerned. Who would not then admire the wiſdome and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of this Generall, in preſerving this little Army, at this time, for a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond fitter occaſion? Who ever then was ſo worthy of the honourable title of a Generallas hee For though he had bin no King, he was a brave war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, and which is more, a good man, magnificent, wiſe, juſt, meeke, indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with learning, and the gift of tongues, and as he had ſtrength of body, and a manlike ſtature; he had alſo the ornaments of the minde, fitting a brave Commander: he knew how to dally, and weary an Army led by ſuch an old Generall as <hi>Tillie</hi> was: for though he did vaunt, he had beaten two Kings before, in an open field, the third King made him, for all his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and old yeares, to be thought but a child againe, having made him traverſe with his Army, before in the winter, from <hi>Rapin</hi> to new <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> and backe againe to <hi>Madeburg,</hi> finding the King did lie in ſuerty at <hi>Swede,</hi> till he was gone, and then tooke in both <hi>Francford</hi> and <hi>Lanſeberg:</hi> and againe, he made him retire from <hi>During</hi> to <hi>Verben,</hi> for a viſit, and then forced him to returne againe to <hi>Saxonie,</hi> with the loſſe of ſix thouſand men, without effecting any thing for his coming, not the leaſt advantage; undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:132555:95"/>himſelfe and his Army by the ſeaſons, ſometimes with the extremity of cold, in the middeſt of winter, and at this time, he made him march in the middeſt of the dogge dayes, for lacke of victualls, and his Majeſty ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving diſcouraged this old Generall and his Army, he thought then, it was fit time to follow, and to ſearch him out, till he was made to fight.</p>
               <p>This reſolute King did not ſleepe long, in ſuffering <hi>Tillies</hi> bravade made before <hi>Verben</hi> to be unrepayed, having the next morning hunted, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his courraſiers with a few number of <hi>Haggapells,</hi> to the middeſt of their Army, having with honour retired againe, he thought <hi>Tillie</hi> was ingaged to ſtorme his Leaguer, in reveng, but all could not winde or draw him to it: But was forced through hunger to retire, all proviſions being taken out of his way, for his Majeſty knew well, when they ſhould be oppreſſed with hunger at their coming, they could thinke on no generous exploit: for oftimes an Army is loſt ſooner by hunger then by fighting, and hunger it ſelfe is crueller a great deale, then the ſword; For to hunger, and to fight valiantly, doth not agree with nature, and in an Army hunger is more intolerable then the thundering of Cannon and Musket: Armes doe reſiſt Armes, but to reſiſt hunger, no Fort, no Strength, no Moate or Foſſie is able to doe it.</p>
               <p>To conclude then this my obſervation,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> when God is with us, all things ſucceede well unto us, as did with this fortunate King <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> who I knew did feare God; and I perſwade my ſelfe, by his example, and after him, by the example of another <hi>Gustavus,</hi> Felt-marſhall <hi>Horne</hi> (who truly feared God in his calling without pride or oſtentation) many others under them following their examples (though Souldiers) did the like. Therefore no wonder, that they and thoſe who followed them, were happy in their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes, having had ſuch Leaders: for that is moſt ſure and infallible, where moſt feare of God is, and true piety, there is moſt happineſſe; and this piety is enough to ſave Princes. And on the contrary, withouther, Armies can doe nothing, Horſe or ſtrength of man, gold or money can doe nothing. Let us then following the example of this King, who was Godly, ſeek to the King of Kings for his Kingdome, &amp; the righteouſneſſe thereof, &amp; then ſurely all other things will goe well with us, as it did with our Maſter and Leader.</p>

And as there is one God in the heavens, that governes all the frame of the earth, ſo the Lord hath his Subſtitutes on earth, whom he hath made above their fellowes in judgment, and herolike vertues, yet he himſelfe keepes the Prerogative above them all in commanding them,

This God then, the author and doer of all things (and of this union and confederacy) that eternall (I ſay) and provident God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, that governes the motions of the Heavens, the ſtarres variable cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the Elementary changes, all things above, and beneath the earth, ruling and governing, ſpreading, where he pleaſeth his light beames from his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and with a winke, piercing into the Bowells of heaven, earth and ſea, be doth not only goe before them, but in them, ſeeing and knowing all, and governing them all, his will is ſo, that he converts our noiſomneſſe unto health, and our ſinnes being ill, he turnes them unto our good: that eternall Governour triumphs in the Chariot of his providence, and if willingly we follow him, then freely, as his Souldiers, if unwillingly, we muſt follow him, as captives and ſervants. We ſee then here by Gods providence, the Duke was contented to joyne his Army with the Kings Majeſties Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come to <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> to goe <hi>Conjunctis viribus</hi> againſt their common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my the houſe of <hi>Austria,</hi> and the Catholique league.</p>

               <p>It had beene good for <hi>Madeburg</hi> this union had beene ſooner concluded, but the Lord would not have it, ſeeing their puniſhments, by Generall <hi>Tillies</hi> Army (their ſcourge) was decreed long before. But now the Duke of <hi>Saxon</hi> terrified by their example, thinkes it better to prevent ſuch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wound, by joyning with his Majeſty, being made warie by others fall: for it is better late to thrive then never, and it is better to prevent evill, then to ſuffer; and it was better for the Duke of <hi>Saxon,</hi> to bluſh in time, then out of time to grow pale; for now being taken at the rebound, <hi>Tillies.</hi> Army being at <hi>Lipſigh,</hi> ſeing his own houſe on fire to be relieved, he offers his ſervice to his Majeſty; damning himſelfe, ſoule and body, if ever he will forſake his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and his Crowne, if then he would but helpe him to beate the enemy out of his country againe: So that he, which could not be tied with one knot before, is now hard tied by foure great points, which he was made to condeſcend unto, on his honour and credit, to have bin kept unviolable. And his Majeſty getting him once thus bound, the way to make him ſure, was to make him fight, that having dipped his hands once in the bloud of his ene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mies, he was not ſuddenly to be clenſed, and this was the manner to tye him harder, then the cuſtome was of old amongſt the <hi>Germans,</hi> who were wont (when they entred in confederacy) to draw bloud in a Goblet of both their browes, and drinke of it mutually, for the more ſtrict obſervance of their fidelities to each others. But ſhortly after this confederacy was made, much <hi>German</hi> bloud was drawne, and of other ſtrangers bloud, to make the tie ſo much the harder, and before the tie was broke, his Majeſties bloud was ſhed, to the perpetuall diſgrace of him, that after his Majeſties death, forgetting his honour and credit, did violate his confederacy made with the crowne, as with the King our Maſter, of never dying memory.</p>

               <head>The ſixteenth Obſervation.</head>
               <p>FIrſt then we ſee here the goodneſſe that followes on that laudable and Chriſtian cuſtome, uſed by thoſe, that doe firſt begin the workes of their calling with their true humiliation to God by prayers, in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging their ſinnes and unworthineſſe, and in renouncing truſt or confidence in any thing but in God alone, knowing their owne wiſdome, ſtrength and valour to be of no moment, without the ſpeciall aide and aſſiſtance of the Almighty and powerfull God; who alone can teach our fingers to fight, giving victory with few as with many.</p>
               <p>And therefore it was that this Magnanimous and religious warriour, with his whole Army, publiquely did call on the Lord, praying for his aſſiſtance againſt his enemies, and for a happy event of the day, before he begun to ſet his Army to worke againſt their enemies, the enemies of God and the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:132555:100"/>true Catholique and Apoſtolique faith; which they had endeavoured to ſubvert with the profeſſors of the truth, to hold up and maintaine the man of ſinne and his erronious doctrine, by the power of the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and of the Catholique League. We ſee then, this duty being religiouſly and piouſly diſcharged by his Majeſty and his Army, the fruite was anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their deſire: having obtained victory over our enemies by the good command of his Majeſty, and the ready obedience, dexterity and valour of his Majeſties ſupreme Officers of the field; who in all charges did direct thoſe under them to the ready diſcharge of their duties, every one of the whole united body of the Army following the example of their head and Leader,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Y"/> the magnifick and Magnanimous King, for to abate and lay downe the pride of the houſe of <hi>Austria;</hi> and for to teare and ſtrip naked that old proud and Ambitious Generall <hi>Tillie</hi> of his former glory and honour; for having bragged and vainely gloried, he had conquered two Kings before: here now the Captaine of Kings, and King of Captaines doth victoriouſly Triumph, having robbed him of glory, and clipped the wings of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire with his little Royall Army.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe, next unto God, a ſecond helpe unto this glorious victory, was the great execution made by his Majeſties Cannon; and though ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Tillie</hi> did pride himſelfe all his life time in the courſe of the warres, in his dexterity of his great Cannon; here from a Maſter he was turned againe unto a prentice, being cunningly over ſhot with Cannon, ſo that his Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and three ſcore waggons belonging thereto, were taken from him by <hi>Guſtavus</hi> the firſt, and moſt valiant Captaine of the world, with the helpe of the nation which was never conquered by any forraine enemy, the invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible <hi>Scots;</hi> whoſe prayers to God were more effectuall through Chriſt, then theirs through the interceſſion of Saints.</p>
               <p>The third cauſe of this glorious victory, was his Majeſties good diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline houlden over the Army, horſe and foote, not ſuffering them without great and extraordinary puniſhment, to oppreſſe the poore, which made them cry for a bleſſing to his Majeſty and his Army.</p>
               <p>The enemy on the contrary provoked the wrath of God againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Army, for their cruelty uſed in torturing the poore, and force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their monies from them did further their puniſhment, and his Majeſties glorious victory.</p>
               <p>The fourth helpe to this victory, was the plottons of Musketiers, his Majeſty had very wiſely ordained to attend the horſemen, being a great ſafety for them, and a great prejudice to the enemy, the Musket ball carrying and piercing farther then the Piſtolet: As alſo the great celerity uſed in charging and diſcharging of our ſmall cannon brought the enemies battaile in diſorder, to the furtherance of this victory: As alſo the extraordinary care and diligence, that was uſed by his Majeſty, and his Officers, in ſeeing and foreſeeing of the defects and diſorders amongſt our ſelves; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuddenly remedied, was alſo a helpe to this victory: And laſt of all, the invincible courage and reſolution both of Officers and ſouldiers in ſtanding firme, Notwithſtanding of the fury of their enemies; and which was more, they were no wayes diſmayed or diſcouraged at the flight of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> but thought it their greateſt glory to be victorious without them; ſtanding re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutly till they ſaw the backe of their enemies, the undoubted tokens of their glorious victory.</p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:132555:100"/>
               <p>His Majeſties Army on this ſervice as at all times, might be called truely valorous, for thoſe are called valorous Captaines, and holden for ſuch; that when their Camerades are flying, they notably with hands, voice and wounds (if wounded) ſuſtaine the fight, doing at once the duty of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and of Captaines, by thoſe meanes, bringing backe, and reſtoring the ſuſpected loſſe unto victory, for their credits. For as ignorance doth eaſily precipitate men into danger, even ſo to a generous heart nothing can ſeeme difficult or fearefull, being once reſolved to fall on,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Z"/> though towards the mouth of the cannon, but before reſolution fleſh and blood have their owne diſturbances, even in the moſt valorous: and valorous men, as they feare nothing after reſolution; ſo they diſdaine nothing entering upon danger.</p>
               <p>Here alſo the reſolution of our horſemen on this ſervice was praiſe worthy, ſeeing they never looſed a piſtoll at the enemy, till firſt they had diſcharged theirs: for the enemy being fierce and furious; while as ours were ſtout and ſlow, the enemy was made weary when ours were freſh, which made the enemy being weary, and charged with a freſh ſuccour, being once ſet on going, they followed hard their victory, not giving them time to breath, or recollect their forces againe, till they were utterly defeated; that the night and darkeneſſe was their beſt ſafety. For I did obſerve here, that the duty of valiant Commanders is to know not onely the nature of their enemies, but alſo their ſpirit, and wherein they pride them moſt: we ought to make our beſt uſe for to deceive and out-ſhoote them in thoſe ſame things wherein they delight and truſt moſt unto. Likewiſe this day I did obſerve,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="&amp;."/> that as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticement to great travell and paines is glory and honour, even ſo courage and conſtant valour may be attained unto by exerciſe in warre, and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of dangers, wherein Souldiers, Companies or Briggads are uſed with, and made once familiar with that cruell and vehement, horrible and terrible fellow, death, having ſeene many dead bodies before; and being inured to bloud, ſuch Souldiers will ſtand to it and deſire to fight, when ignorant Novices (as the <hi>Saxons</hi> were) are afraid of death; who ſeeking their ſafety in flying, they were miſerably cut downe by their enemies.</p>
               <p>I did likewiſe obſerve this day, that it is not the multitude doth the turne, but under God it is good command, good conduct, art, and skill in hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the weapons of our warfare, and in taking the occaſions in time that beget victory.</p>
               <p>Therefore he that would labour an Army as <hi>Gustavus</hi> did,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> he will finde fruite, yea even the beſt that groweth under the Empire, good Rheniſh and Necker wine, not onely for himſelfe, but for the meaneſt Souldier, and that unto exceſſe, which hath made me ſometimes complaine more of the plenty our Souldiers had after this victory, through the abuſe of it, then ever I did before for any penury. He is therefore in my opinion farre deceived that thinkes that it is the time or number of yeares that makes a good Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier; no, no, it is rather the continuall meditation of exerciſe and practiſe; for Souldiers ſhould be in running, not in running away, as horſemen ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily doe. But on the contrary, that with the greater force they may be able to invade their enemies, as our Briggad did here, who ſeeing the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in confuſion with their Pikes charged ranne fiercely upon them till they were beaten. And ſurely I doe thinke no man ſo ignorant, but knowes that more come to be good Souldiers by exerciſe and frequency of danger and uſe, then by nature: and he is not a man that will not ſweat, nor couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:132555:101"/>that eſchewes danger, when hee ſhould fight, as our <hi>Camerades</hi> did the painted Souldiers the <hi>Saxons,</hi> with their plumed Officers; which feathers ſerved them I thinke in their flight, for tokens rather to cut them downe by, than for their ſafeties.</p>
               <p>Courage ſhould growe by frequencie of danger, the onely way, in my opinion, to feare nothing, and then he may be called ſtout, before the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of a quarrell at home, who once drawing a ſworde, when he knowes of twentie Parters, or Redders, is there called ſtout; but when he comes abroade to the warres,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> at firſt, the thundering of the Cannon and Musket roaring in his eares makes him ſicke, before he come neere danger, as I have known ſome: but where vertue and honour doth growe, there labour, exerciſe and danger is needfull: <hi>Nam ardua &amp; difficilis virtutis est via, tamen, nil tam diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile eſt, quod non ſolertia vincat;</hi> And death it ſelfe is never bitter, when it leaves an immortall, and glorious name behind it; <hi>Vivit enim poſt funera virtus: &amp; animus moderatis laboribus adjuvatur, immoderatis autem abluitur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude then this obſervation, we ſee that as courage in warres is much worth, for obtaining of victory: ſo is the wiſedome of a Generall or Leader in warres, as <hi>Guſtavus</hi> was, of ſo much worth, even in the obtaining of this victory, that the ſpirit of him alone, and skill in direction, was better than thouſands of armed men. The enemy being in this Battaile neere twelve thouſand men, at leaſt, ſtronger than we; yet <hi>Gustavus</hi> alone on our ſide was better, and of more worth to us, then that multitude to our enemies.</p>
               <p>Wee ſee then here,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that no greater joy or pleaſure can come to mortall man, than to overcome his enemy by Armes: and we ſee alſo, that the event of Battaile doth not conſiſt in number of Fighters, but, under God, in the order and courage uſed in Battaile.</p>
               <p>Here alſo we ſee, that a good cauſe and a good quarrell is ever to be had, if thou wouldeſt have victory over thine enemies; and who would wiſh a better quarrell then we fought for, this day being for the reliefe of our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed friends, and for the libertie and promotion of Chriſts Goſpell; or who would not hazard, in ſuch a quarrell, eſpecially againſt ſuch enemies, that had baniſhed the daughter of our dread Soveraigne, and her royall Iſſue, from her Kingdome and Dignities?</p>
               <p>O would to GOD I had once ſuch a Leader againe to fight ſuch an other day; in this old quarrell! And though I died ſtanding, I ſhould be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, I died well; and I wiſh, that as wee have received the light of truth hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily, that fought in that quarrell: even ſo we may happen to reſtore that light againe pleaſantly; that as wee did overcome that day our carnall enemies; even ſo we may overcome in our laſt fight our ſpirituall enemies; that after death we may be crowned with immortall Glorie.</p>

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:132555:101"/>eſcaped with his life, he had a torne skinne, and a bruſed bodie; and being long chaſed, in end he got a hole to hide him in: for ſure he did thinke, there was no long ſafetie for him, if oft hee did but meete with ſuch cunning hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; that had laid all paſſes for him, to keepe him in: for though, at this time, hee had ſtripped away his taile, yet his traine (for the moſt part) were either taken or killed.</p>
               <p>Other Diſcourſes wee had of plentie, and of want, being ſome of us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely hungrie, others pined with extraordinary thirſt, having no water neere unto us, nor veſſels to bring it from a farre, our ſervants being left farre behind us, who were plundred by thoſe cowards that had fled from us, who alſo furniſhed a great part of our nights Diſcourſe, having wondered at their carriage, that had ſuch externall ſhowes, with ſo few inward giftes of the minde.</p>
               <p>The night thus paſt, the day peeping, every one, that miſſed a loving friend, or a Camerade, went neere to the ground, on which they ſundered, making diligent ſearch to finde them, either dead or alive; ſundries of both were found, the dead were put under ground, being honourably buried like ſouldiers, that had given their lives for the weale of the publique, the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded were convoyed unto <hi>Dorpes,</hi> where Chirurgians were appointed to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their cure.</p>
               <p>By nine of the Clocke, the Armie was drawne up in Battaile, where the difference was great, betwixt our ſhow then, and the ſight of the day before; His Majeſtie having overviewed the Armie, he tooke the moſt part of the Horſemen with him, and commanded to march towards <hi>Leipſigh</hi> with the reſt of the Armie, to be reſted there till further Orders; and His Majeſtie with the Horſemen advanced after the enemie; proſecuting the victorie, in taking Order with thoſe they had left behind, for making their Retreate ſure, whereof there were left at <hi>Leipſigh</hi> three thouſand men, whom His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie in his by-going gave Orders to purſue, and advanced to a Caſtle called <hi>Morſhberg,</hi> where there were a great many of the enemie, who rendred them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and tooke ſervice.</p>

               <p>HEre we found the Proverbe verified,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> that they never had an evill day, who got a merry night after: and the long expectation of this our happineſſe made our joye the more welcome; for wee helped with great labour, toyle, and travell to have brought this dayes worke to a good end: we rejoyced that the labour and danger being vaniſhed, the good of it remained with us: and though our Commons were but ſhort, our mirth was never the leſſe; for we ought not to care how laborious or painefull our actions are, if the fruite be honeſt and good; for though the paines be firſt tedious,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> yet betime they will yeeld content. What matter is it then of our toyle, and travell; or what care ſhould we take of trouble or danger, ſo our joyes may be enlarged? <hi>Iob</hi> was not ſo miſerable in his affliction, as he was happy in his patience. Which ſhould teach all men of our Profeſſion to beare their diſturbances and troubles patiently; that in end they may come to their wiſhed for credit and honour.

               <p>Here alſo we ſee,

               <p>Here alſo we ſee, that death is fatall unto all, both to feeble and couragious, but a glorious death is onely proper unto the valiant; who ofteſt doth eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew death, when the fearefull periſheth in an inſtant; and therefore it is that the valiant man doth chooſe rather to die honourably, than to live in ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy, as the feeble doth; but theſe died here valiantly; the brightneſſe of their Actions, done in their life time, remaines firme in the minds of men unto all ages; And to their poſterities in writing, never ſuffering their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories to rotte with the time; whoſe burialls, though meane, on this place of Battaile, yet they are commemorations of their vertuous lives to poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie; whoſe killing was no puniſhment (ſay the world what they liſt) but rather the beginning of their glory: And therefore, how ever a man dies, he dies well that dies in Chriſt, ending his dayes with honour.</p>
               <p>At this dayes ſervice I was rich in friends, that helped to the obtaining of this victory with credit; but ſoone after we found the fruits of mortalitie, death having ſeaſed more on our kindred, than on any other Family of our Nation, that were employed in this warre; and the unthankfulneſſe of thoſe we ſerved hath beene ſuch, that thoſe who ſuffered moſt, were leaſt rewarded; as we may juſtly ſay, having loſt our Maſter and King, who did ſee our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and had rewarded them, had he lived.

               <head>The eighteenth Obſervation.</head>
               <p>THIS great Army of Generall <hi>Tillies</hi> being defeated, did ſeparate themſelves in great Troopes and bands, eſpecially the foote; who ought ever to ſtand well, and fight with courage bouldly in field, and not to ſuffer themſelves to be rent; though the horſemen ſhould runne away,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> and being they cannot runne ſo faſt for their ſafeties; my counſell then ſhall be ever to them, to fight well for victory, and though they ſhould loſe all hope of victory, I would not have them to disbandon or ſcatter; but rather to ſtand together, till at laſt they might get honourable quarters for themſelves, rather then ſhamefully to be cut off in flying away.</p>
               <p>Here we ſee, that the foote Souldiers ſuffer ever the greateſt loſſe in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, and they have ever leaſt gaines, though moſt credit: but we ſee his Majeſty with clemency doth follow the example of the ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> who, of all victories, thought that victory beſt, which leaſt was ſtained with bloud, having given quarters and ſervice to three thouſand Emperiall Souldiers, without drawing one drop of bloud.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe we ſee here the continuance of his Majeſties induſtry and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, aſwell in proſecuting his victory, as he was valiant in obtaining of it, in the one as in the other vindicating his owne honour, and the honour of his noble friends, ſhewing, after the fury was paſt, his clemency and meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe towards his enemies; yet who ever was more valiant than he, being ever in all his on-ſets a Leader? And as we ſee his Majeſties valour and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, in proſecuting his victory: ſo we ſee alſo his care, in ſupplying the weakeneſſe of his Army, as a wiſe Generall ſhould doe, in not letting his enemies ſee the weakeneſſe of his Army, which ought never to be knowne to thoſe, who would rejoyce at the ſame.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe here I did obſerve a great thankefulneſſe in a King, in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging openly in view of an Army, the good ſervice done by his ſervants: wherein I did eſpecially ſee his love to our Nation beyond all others, that did
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:132555:104"/>ſerve him, to make other Nations emulous of their glory, in following of their vertues; and though his Majeſty uſed them here,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="N"/> rather like unto friends then to ſervants, it ſhould not make them the more ſawcy, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the more humble, as both Officers and Souldiers did verifie, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing the continuance of their faithfull obedience, and of better ſervice, as the Lord would enable them, on the next occaſions.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe we did ſee here, how few of our Nation are induced to ſerve thoſe Catholique Potentates: and for my part, I finde the reaſon good: for if we have any enemies in <hi>Europe,</hi> it muſt be thoſe, that would not onely overthrow our eſtates at home (if they could) but alſo would force us (if it lay in their powers) to make ſhipwracke of our conſciences, by leading us unto Idolatry.</p>
               <p>Moreover we ſee here, that his Majeſty and the Duke of <hi>Saxon</hi> having once beene companions of danger together, they were then entertaining one anothers familiarity, in renewing of their friendſhip, confirmed againe with the <hi>German</hi> cuſtome, in making their League the firmer, by drinking brother-ſhip together, where I having entred the <hi>Hall,</hi> and being ſeene by his Majeſty, I was preſently kindely embraced by houlding his Arme over my ſhoulder: wiſhing I could beare as much drinke, as old Generall Major <hi>Ruthven,</hi> that I might helpe his Majeſty to make his Gueſts merry, and holding me faſt by the hand, calling to the Duke of <hi>Saxon,</hi> declared unto him, what ſervice our Nation had done his Father and him, and the beſt laſt, at <hi>Leipſigh:</hi> commending in particular to the Duke, Colonell <hi>Hepburne,</hi> and <hi>Lumſdell,</hi> and having called Colonell <hi>Hepburne</hi> unto him, he did reiterate the former diſcourſe, and much more, in commendation of the <hi>Scots.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the continuance of this warre in <hi>Germany</hi> (as the ſequell of the Story will prove) from the Balticke coaſt unto the <hi>Alpes</hi> and <hi>Tyroll;</hi> where Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell <hi>Hepburne</hi> was ſent out as Colonell, to command a party, I was ſent with him, as his ſecond, being ever much obliged unto him, not onely for his love on thoſe occaſions, but alſo for his good counſell, he being long before me in the <hi>Swedens</hi> ſervice. And as we were oft Camerades of danger together; ſo being long acquainted, we were Camerades in love: firſt at Colledge, next in our travells in <hi>France,</hi> at <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Poictiers,</hi> Anno 1615. till we met againe in <hi>Spruce</hi> at <hi>Elben</hi> in Auguſt 1630.


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="O"/> Nothing therefore in my opinion, more worthy to be kept next unto Faith, then this kinde of friendſhip, growne up with education, confirmed by familiarity, in frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the dangers of warre; and who is more worthy to be choſen for a friend, then one who hath ſhowne himſelfe both valiant and conſtant againſt his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, as the worthy <hi>Hepburne</hi> hath done, who is generally ſo well knowne in Armies, that he needes no teſtimony of a friend, having credit and reputation enough amongſt his enemies.</p>
               <p>To conclude then this obſervation as I begunne it, I cannot but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his Majeſties wiſdome and fore-ſight, in bringing the Rex-chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor <hi>Oxenſterne</hi> on the <hi>Dutch</hi> bottome, to be ſecond to his Majeſty, and to free him of a part of his buthens, by placeing him at <hi>Hall</hi> (as Legate) being <hi>Centrum Germania.</hi>

               <p>The ſeventeenth of September, our firſt nights quarter was taken at a Dorpe, two miles from <hi>Hall;</hi> where thoſe of <hi>Erfort</hi> being ſo diſpleaſed at our coming, as unwilling to entertaine ſuch Gueſts (they being all Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, Ieſuits and Monkes) being mightily afraid, they did ſend their Commiſſioners before them, to treate with his Majeſty, but his Majeſty did give them their anſwers, by Duke <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Wymar,</hi> that they ſhould quit the Catholique faction, and give their oath of fidelity to his Majeſty of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and that they ſhould take in his Garriſons within their Towne, and render up to his Majeſty the Caſtle of <hi>Eryackburg,</hi> with the Colleges to come in his Majeſties will; who ſhould ſuffer them to be untroubled in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, paying their contribution to the warres, like the other Burgers and country.</p>

               <p>The Councell being called to come on the market place, they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to render the Towne keyes unto the Duke; who getting the keyes, the Towne was taken without bloud.</p>

               <p>His Majeſty having reſted the Army ſome few dayes, Duke <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Wymar</hi> was made Stat-houlder,

               <p>HIs Majeſtie at this time, as formerly, uſed great expedition in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching unto <hi>Franoonia,</hi> knowing it was one of the Circles of the whole Empire, that was of moſt importance for the enemy; being a ſtraite and a ſtrong Country, by reaſon of the ſtrengths within it: And therefore it was, that he divided his Armie in croſſing the <hi>Vault,</hi> at divers places; that his Artillery might paſſe the ſooner through. For he knew, who ever was Maſter of <hi>Wurtzburg,</hi> he commanded the whole River of the <hi>Maine,</hi> and conſequently, whole <hi>Franconia;</hi> which fortunately happened, according to his Majeſties deliberation.</p>
               <p>Here alſo we ſee the evill that comes of greedineſſe, in making generall Commanders to be hated by thoſe that follow them; for <hi>Bawtizen</hi> having got a great ſumme of money of theſe Townes, by the helpe and ſervice of the foote, it became him, according to right and diſcretion, to have ſhared with the Colonells, who commanded the Briggads and Regiments; but ſeeing his want of diſcretion in not acknowledging them, they being once joyned againe to his Majeſties Army, would never conſent to be commanded by him a foot-ſtep afterwards, for ought his Majeſtie could doe, having dealt ſo niggardly with <hi>Cavaliers</hi> of their worth, ſo that his Majeſtie was forced to direct him to command elſewhere.</p>
               <p>This greedineſſe is the moſt peſtiferous roote, that ever grew in a generall Commander; for on this march, Souldiers were uſually commanded to lie in the Fields, and not ſuffered to quarter in the Townes,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Z"/> which they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, for feare to hinder the payment of the moneys impoſed on them; ſo that publique employment is ill beſtowed upon a greedy perſon; and this greedineſſe in a man of warre, to gather riches, may loſe him all his fortunes; and avarice hath beene the loſſe of many Armies, and of many Kingdomes alſo; for no vice is more peſtiferous in the extraordinary uſe, than this, to bring a man to be diſdained of others, eſpecially of thoſe would follow him.</p>
               <p>Here alſo we ſee, that of old, our Nation was much eſteemed of abroad, eſpecially the Clergie, who in all Kingdomes, as in <hi>Germanie,</hi> had their
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:132555:107"/>Cloiſters, as here, and at <hi>Erfort;</hi> and he was a <hi>Scots</hi> man, that brought the Chriſtian Religion firſt into <hi>Franconia,</hi> but was evill rewarded, being there afterwards murthered.</p>
               <p>It was the cuſtome obſerved ordinarily by his Majeſty of <hi>Sweden,</hi> to make uſe of our countrimen on ſervice, wherein he deſired they ſhould ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves examplary to others, as at this time, he made choice of Sr. <hi>Iames Ramſey</hi> and Sr. <hi>Iohn Hamilton,</hi> to be the firſt ſhould adventure, of the whole Army, to force the enemy to give way to his Majeſty to ſet his Army over the Maine; where, on that bridge Major <hi>Bodwell</hi> and his brother being killed, were buried in <hi>Wurtzburg</hi> Church, leaving the Trophie of their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour amongſt ſtrangers, in honour of the Nation, that was ever glorious abroad.</p>
               <p>Sr. <hi>Iohn Hamilton</hi> diſdaining the orders his Majeſty did give, for ſtorming the Caſtle, having employed the <hi>Sweds</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> on the ſtorme, neglecting him and the <hi>Scots,</hi> who had made the way to the reſt, in the extremity of the danger,

Which ſhould teach all Cavaliers that ſerve truely abroad to take their time with credit of thoſe they ſerve, ſeeing they doe not reſpect Cavaliers, but when they have moſt uſe of them,</p>
               <p>Here then we ſee that no ſtrength, be it never ſo ſtrong, is able to hould out, when as God doth not watch the Fort, the watch-man watches in vaine, and we ſee by the ſubmiſſion of <hi>Franconie</hi> after this victory, that the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious Enſignes are ever followed: for where Fortune doth favour, there the Commons doe follow, and their ſtudy alſo with their favour followes the victorious.</p>

               <p>At this time, his Majeſtie ſtood in neede of aſſiſtance and good Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, having enemies on all hands, and a ſtrong enemy; the Country alſo unſure, being unfriends and Papiſts, and he being wiſe, reſolved without giving Battaile, his beſt was, to preſſe to overcome them with the ſeaſon, with hunger and cold, with marches and delayes, keeping himſelfe within walles, he knew well twelve Souldiers with a good Officer to direct them, were better, being willing to attend, than a hundred naked and hungry Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers without, whereby his enemies Armie were undone, without hurt or detriment of his owne,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> being well commanded, and well foreſeene and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided of all neceſſaries, having given them beſides, as reward of their former ſervices, a little money, knowing well how hungry men could be contented with little, in time of neede: for he reſolved, if the enemy purſued him hard within <hi>Wurtzburg,</hi> he could not ſuffer himſelfe to be beleaguered with a ſtrong Armie, in a ſtraite place; and to goe to the Fields with a diſcontented weake Armie (which it behooved him to doe) was not good. The conſideration of this forced him to give ſome moneys in hand, to content them, and hand-writ, and aſſignations for more moneys to be payd unto them out of <hi>Newrenberg,</hi> within ſix moneths afterwards.</p>
               <p>As alſo his Majeſtie knew well the enemies Armie neere hand, hearing

               </p>
               <p>Here alſo we are inſtructed, as well by his Majeſties politique government, as by his military; He being alike expert in both, diſcharging the dutie of a King, and a Generall, <hi>Tam Arte, quam Marte:</hi> for the enemy was no ſooner gone, but incontinent his Majeſtie cauſed ſerve his publique <hi>Edicts,</hi> for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Country-men, to give their oaths of fidelitie; moving them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to partly by compulſion, and partly by promiſes of dutie and of libertie to their Conſciences, two ſtrong Arguments to move thoſe to obedience, who had ſeene their friends forced to turne backes upon them, from whom, under God, they did expect Reliefe to come.</p>
               <p>Moreover we ſee here, that thoſe who are honoured by God,

               <p>In this point of recognoſcing his Majeſties judgement was wonderfull, as in all other practicall duties fitting a great Commander, and as his Majeſties judgement was great and good, ſo he was of that minde, nothing in this kinde could be well done, which he did not himſelfe, neither could his Majeſtie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide, at ſuch times, as he went to recognoſce, any other to accompany him in the danger, other reaſons doubtleſſe His Majeſtie had, which were onely privie unto himſelfe. This point how neceſſarie it is, for a great Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be judicious of no Souldier will doubt.</p>
               <p>Here alſo we ſee, His Majeſtie made no difference of ſeaſon, or weather, in proſecuting his enemie, when ever he found any advantage. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was His Majeſties wiſe reſolution, to croſſe the <hi>Rhine,</hi> while Generall <hi>Tillies</hi> Armie, in the Winter time, was fartheſt from him, and making but a faint here before <hi>Oppenham,</hi> his ayme and deſigne was to croſſe the <hi>Rhine</hi> at an other part by ſhipping, that while the enemie was buſied in defence of the Skonce, His Majeſtie might croſſe at an other part: for the Armie once croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the Skonce was loſt, for want of ſupplie; and His Majeſtie once over, the whole <hi>Paltz</hi> and <hi>Mentz</hi> were in feare.</p>
               <p>Nothing is more powerfull to reſiſt reſolution,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="W"/> than reſolution: for it is
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:132555:112"/>ſaid of the <hi>Oake,</hi> being hard timber, for to cleave it a ſunder, there muſt be wedges made of it ſelfe, that hardneſſe may overcome hardneſſe. My adviſe then to all brave fellowes watching in trenches, or guarding Cannon, while as the enemie would try their valour by out-falling, in aſſailing them, at ſuch times, let the defender doe as was done here, leaving the uſe of the Musket, as being more unreadie, let them make uſe of their pikes, meeting their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in the teeth, with a ſtrong firme bodie of Pikes, (after the old <hi>Scots</hi> faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, uſed by our Predeceſſours, that fought pell mell; with two-hand ſwordes, till one of the parties did quit the field) for though they ſuffer loſſe, ſure they muſt winne credit, that repulſe their enemie, rather than diſgracefully ſuffer their Cannon to be nayled, or their braines knockt out in trenches, while as they take them to the uncertaintie of the musket. Therefore let reſolution be ever preſent, repulſing force with force; for if thou wouldeſt be eſteemed amongſt the number of brave fellowes, thou muſt reſolve to ſhew thy ſelfe reſolute, couragious, and valiant, going before others in good example, choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing rather to dye with credit ſtanding, ſerving the publique, than ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to live in ſhame, diſgracing both thy ſelfe and Countrie. Who would not then at ſuch times chooſe vertue before vice; glorie, honour, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall fame, before an ignominious, ſhamefull, and deteſtable life?


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> Let then my deere Camerades of the Brittiſh Nation, where ever they ſerve, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace this my exhortation, and lay it up in the ſecret corners of their heart and minde, that they may be ever mindefull of their credits, preferring credit to life, for the honour of the invincible Nation, doing ever, as was done here by their Countrie men, in one night thrice, at three ſeverall partes, whereof twice in ſight of their King and Maſter.</p>

Let us then be content with our lot, and though the meanes we ſhould live on, be detained from us, yet let us wrong no body by oppreſſion, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering by unlawfull meanes, and doubtleſſe the Lord will conſerve our healths, and ſuſtaine our bodies with ſufficiency, and ſo being honeſt, we neede never be aſhamed to be thought poore in mens eſteeme, being rich in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Here alſo I did obſerve,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that oftentimes thoſe, that durſt not lift up their beads in time of danger, doe often better ſpeed and thrive in worldly things, than thoſe that merit the beſt: as was ſeene on thoſe Briggads entred firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Mentz,</hi> that did get both Priſoners and ſpoyle with the beſt Quarters, when others, that deſerved better, were worſe quartered in emptie houſes, while as other Colonells and Souldiers, of farre leſſe deſerving, were making up of eſtates for their poſteritie, in better Quarters, within the <hi>Paltz</hi> and <hi>Franckonie.</hi>

               <p>But on the contrary; valourous men their labours and travells ought to be rewarded, with honour and profit, by thoſe they did truely ſerve.

Where we ſee, that all Potentates and great Kings, doe keepe no Confederacy nor League, but only ſo farre as they are helpfull for their owne aimes and deſignes; preferring their benefit before the keeping of their covenants; where we ſee, that Kings hand-writings or ſeales, in pactions making, tye them no more then as nothing, when they finde them prejudiciall to their owne greatneſſe, and cannot be made to keepe their covenants, but with ſtronger power. Then we ſee here, his Majeſty of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> was nothing moved with the King of <hi>France</hi> his threatning (except he would retire over the Rhine againe) ſeeing he knew his owne ability at that time; that being once over the Rhine, he could march unto <hi>France.</hi> The conſideration whereof made them agree better on ſecondary conditions, having paſt from the firſt covenant; ſo that we ſee there is no dealing with Kings but on equall termes; and then are they moſt reaſonable; but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Kings, in this point of their covenants, is not to be imitated by any other inferiours; for in reſpect of them, though not in reſpect of God, they are privileged perſons; who cannot be puniſhed for their faults but by God alone. And therefore, amongſt inferiours, nothing is to be kept more ſtrict next unto faith unviolated, then mens word and promiſe, eſpecially promiſes betwixt old friends. But alas! no friendſhip is permanent, ſeeing
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:132555:119"/>many things come betwixt, turning it unto hatred and hoſtility; for where love doth not grow, the friendſhip is not durable.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe here we ſee, his Majeſty of <hi>France</hi> made haſte to interpoſe his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt for the weale of the Catholique League, ſhewing himſelfe diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with their uſage, to make them the more ready to thinke on him, before they ſhould any wayes leane in their neceſſity to the King of <hi>Sweden.</hi> As alſo we ſee the policy of the League, though in their neceſſity they ſeemed to make uſe of the King of <hi>France</hi> his friendſhip, yet they would not caſt off the houſe of <hi>Austria,</hi> and King of <hi>Spaine</hi> their ould friends, for the hope they had in their new friend the King of <hi>France,</hi> leſt their new friend might diſappoint them of their expectations, as he did in th'end, miſſing his owne aimes.</p>
               <p>We ſee alſo here the <hi>Frenches</hi> policy, in making haſte to intercede for the <hi>Leagueiſtes,</hi> leſt the danger might come on himſelfe; for the King of <hi>France</hi> hearing the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> had croſſed the Rhine, he did not ſtay to bring his Army together,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="W"/> till the League ſhould call for his helpe, leſt it ſhould be too late, but incontinent brought his Army to the <hi>Moſell,</hi> and then ſent his Ambaſſador to <hi>Mentz</hi> to his Majeſty of <hi>Sweden</hi> to treat, having his Army at hand, which was the only ſure way then to get the better condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, knowing the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> had already too many Irons in the fire.</p>
               <p>Thoſe we ſee are the beſt friends, that in neceſſity keepe their paction, as the Catholique League did at all times unto the Emperour, who otherwiſe had bin no Emperour, neither yet had he bin Emperour, had the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts kept together and hazarded their meanes and bloud, in defence of the publique cauſe, as the Catholiques did in their greateſt neceſſity, once eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry yeere ſetting up ever new Armies, as one was beaten unto them: their wiſdome and conſtancy were ſo great, that preſently the next Spring, through their power and diligence, they had ever another new Army afoote, which in th'end made their enemies the Evangeliſts weary, ſparing their meanes,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> they ſuffered in a manner the cauſe and the publique to be neere loſt; being ſince beaten by their owne Armes and meanes, ſeeing they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected time, while as they might employ their meanes to the finall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of their enemies and yet to my knowledge, in <hi>Germany,</hi> if they would conjoyne their ſtrengths together conſtantly againſt the Papiſts, they are powerfull enough to free all <hi>Germany</hi> of Popery, baniſhing them over the <hi>Alpes,</hi> from whence they came. And I perſwade my ſelfe, none that knowes <hi>Germany,</hi> but in his conſcience he muſt confeſſe this to be truth. But when our fellowes in friendſhip faile us, as the Evangeliſts one after another, for a skurvy loſſe, quit the Crowne of <hi>Sweden,</hi> the great Duke of <hi>Saxon</hi> having left them firſt,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Y"/> breaking his oath and promiſe, in prejudice of the publique peace, excluding the Proteſtants impionſly for his owne aimes, he did prejudice the Goſpell, his country, and confederates, and by his evill example: for plaine neceſſity, while a ſtorme ſhould blow over the townes of the upper Circles of the Empire, as <hi>Strasburg, Vlme, Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renberg</hi> &amp; <hi>Francford</hi> did accept of an unſetied peace, contrary to their mindes, in prejudice of the publique, lofing themſelves and the publique, for the loſſe of one day, being without their head, which firſt brought them together.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Z"/> Here then we ſee the great difference of friendſhip in profperity and in
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:132555:119"/>adverſity: for his Majeſty of <hi>Sweden</hi> being at <hi>Francford,</hi> as a victorious King, he had then, in his proſperity, the conflux of friendſhip, ſome ſeeking his protection, others his friendſhip and confederacy, others for feare of the dint of his Armes, ſeeking to be Neutrall, who before were enemies; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kings and Potentats, Republiques and Cities ſending their Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours congratulating his ſucceſſe; yea, and which was more and rare to be ſeene, his Majeſty of <hi>Bohemia</hi> in perſon came unto him, to offer him aſſiſtance Royall, in leavying of an Army for himſelfe, and was refuſed, as unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling other Armies ſhould be in <hi>Dutchland,</hi> to be participant of his glory, but his owne. Where we ſee Fortunes Favourit laught on by the world, but how ſoone againe Fortune begun to frowne on his ſucceſſour, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving got but one Buffer, all men would kill him, his friends <hi>(nomine ten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>)</hi> aſwell as his enemies. Where we ſee cleerely that there is no friend in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, except it be a friend in Chriſt, who will never forſake or leave us. This then is the friendſhip we ſhould make to league and confederate with, our brethren in Chriſt, with whom we have unity in Faith; if that we would have our friendſhip durable and conſtant: others will change as the winde blowes plenty or penury upon us; being but temporary friends (as many of the <hi>Dutch</hi> are) but our brethren in Chriſt will never totally leave us,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Z"/> no not in our greateſt wants and extremity of Fortune. Which ſhould make us chooſe ſuch, and to live and dye with ſuch, fighting for them and their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, who will never leave us, though death ſever us, but after death, they will prove conſtant friends to our ſucceſſours (as the <hi>Germans</hi> did not to the Chancellor of <hi>Sweden</hi>) if they ſucceede unto us in the true and undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Faith. And to verifie this, I can beare witneſſe, that though the enemy did keepe our brethren in Chriſt, that were in the <hi>Paltz,</hi> under ten yeares bondage; Nevertheleſſe that bondage, nor the tyranny uſed unto them by their enemies, made them never forget their fidelity and love to their King and Prince; neither yet could their tyranny make them forſake or renounce their faith in Chriſt, but as they continued true to God, ſo were they faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in their love to their King and Maſter; not only to his Majeſty, but alſo ſhewed their love and kindneſſe unto us, being his Majeſties friends, whom they knew to be one in faith with themſelves. And therefore they were ever ready and willing to undergoe alike danger with us againſt our common enemies; as doth witneſſe their aſſiſtance given to the <hi>Scots</hi> of Sir <hi>Iames Ramſeys</hi> Regiment, having <hi>Conjunctis viribus</hi> beaten their enemies on divers occaſions.</p>
               <p>The Kings Majeſty of <hi>Sweden,</hi>


                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> though before this time none of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Kings, yet in this warre, having begun with a little Army of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſtrong, in three yeares time he grew ſo great, that he was careleſſe of the threatning of the great King of <hi>France,</hi> having entertained then in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe foure Armies at once, his owne which he led himſelfe, under which I was ſtill; The Felt-marſhall <hi>Guſtavus Hornes</hi> Armie, Generall <hi>Totts</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my on the <hi>Wazer,</hi> and the Marqueſſe of <hi>Hamiltons</hi> Army, with whom <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier</hi> was joyned on the <hi>Elve.</hi> Theſe foure Armies his Majeſty commanded alike, and at one time, having the Emperour, the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> the Catholique League, and the Duke of <hi>Bavier</hi> his enemies. And though the Duke of <hi>Saxon</hi> had an Army apart, yet his Majeſtie would not ſuffer the King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Lunenburg</hi> the Landgrave of <hi>Heſſen,</hi> nor the Dukes of <hi>Wymar</hi> to lead Armies in <hi>Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:132555:120"/>but as Subalternes to his Command.

Notwithſtanding of all theſe forces led and commanded by his Majeſtie of <hi>Sweden,</hi> we ſee that the Empire is like a depth without a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, that cannot be ſounded. For though they loſt ſeverall Battailes, their power was ſo great, that incontinent they made up Armies againe, one after another, for the ſpace of twentie yeares together; ſo that, with difficultie, they made the body of the Empire to ſtand, though the wings were very neere clipped by his Majeſtie of <hi>Sweden;</hi> who, in three yeares time, ſubdued the moſt part of the Empire, and with his owne little Armie, in one Winter,

               <p>This victory happily attained unto by his Majeſty, incontinent the Towne of <hi>Rhine,</hi> being the firſt frontier Garriſon in <hi>Bavaria,</hi> rendered up, and his Majeſty having beſet <hi>Rhine</hi> with a Garriſon, he marched with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my alongſt the <hi>Leacke</hi> ſide on <hi>Ausburg;</hi>

Wherin we have a notable example of an old expert Generall, who being ſeventy two yeeres of age, was ready to die in defence of his Religion and Country, and in defence of thoſe whom he ſerved, being then Generall for the Catholique League: which end of his ſhould encourage all brave Cavaliers, following the lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable profeſſion of Armes, to follow his example in life and death, as va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous Souldiers: where we ſee, that though death be fatall unto all, yet ſuch a death, as happened unto this old Generall, is only proper unto the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, who though often contemned death and eſchewed death, during the warfare, yet at laſt he is overtaken by Gods Almighty hand and power, though formerly in his life-time he had eſcaped, by the ſame providence, many dangers. And ſometimes we ſee in the very entrance of warres, ſome ſuddenly taken away, to teach us alwayes to truſt more unto God then unto the arme of man, which is but a vaine ſtrength.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe, though this worthy Generall did fight often, and obtained ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny notable victories till this time, againſt Kings, yet at laſt he is overcome by a King, and a more skilfull Generall then he was, and though before the battaile of <hi>Leipſigh,</hi> he did give no higher title to his Majeſty then to a Cavalier: Nevertheleſſe his Majeſty hearing of his death, called him Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable old <hi>Tilly,</hi> whoſe Acts were ſo Heroicke in his life time, that after his death, they were his everlaſting monuments, making his memory e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, ſuffering his name never to rot with the time. And my wiſh were, I might prove as valiant in advancing Chriſts Kingdome (though I ſhould die in the quarrell) as he was forward in hindering of it; my death then ſhould not be bitter unto my friends, I leaving an immottall name behinde me.</p>
               <p>Alſo here we ſee the great force of Artillery, either in forcing of paſſes againſt our enemies, or in maintaining of paſſes with a little advantage of ground, for ſeventy two peeces of Ordinance, with ſuch continuance, were of mighty force to make paſſage to an Army: for this victory was obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the force of our Cannon alone, which made the enemy runne away, before we could come at them to fight, and the diſcouragment given unto them, by the loſſe of their Leaders cauſed their diſorder, and conſequently ſafety to us in our paſſage. Where we ſee, that as victorie is from God, ſo the helpe, judgment and dexterity of good Commanders is furtherſome to the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as the lawfull meanes ordained by God.</p>
               <p>Moreover we ſee here, how eaſie it is for a victorious Armie, that is once maſter of the Field, to take in Frontier Garriſons, while as they are poſſeſſed inſtantly with a Panicke feare, eſpecially being taken at the Stot or rebound, before they have time to diſgeſt their feare. But had Generall <hi>Tilly</hi> drawne up
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:132555:125"/>his Army out of reach of his Majeſties Cannon,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> and reſolved to ſuffer his Majeſty to have ſet over his Army, the paſſe being ſo narrow, that ſcarce three men could march in Front, <hi>Tillies</hi> advantage had bin the greater to receive them as they came, who might have cut them off by diviſions, which had bin more to his credit: yet we ſee as the Prophet ſaies, <hi>Except the LORD watch, the watch-man watchethin vaine.</hi> And we ſee, God would have theſe people puniſhed for their former cruelties; and therefore he tooke away their judgment, and confounded their Counſell, making them erre, till they ranne to their owne ruine.</p>
               <p>As his Majeſties Iudgment in command was great, ſo his Example was good and commendable, in giving God thankes in his Church, for his victories and for the preſervation of his life from danger; wherein his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty chiefely ſhewed the example of his Piety and religious exerciſe, for he knew well that Religion and Iuſtice were the fundaments of all good ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and being much inclined unto both, he would winne the people by his owne example: ſince of all men it becomes Kings and Princes worſt to be irreligious and ungodly:

               <p>The uſe then we ſhould make of this, who profeſſe another truth, is to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre their examples of life, as we doe their doctrine; ſeeing wee ſhould know, that no crime before God is ſo abominable, as to glory in ſinne; for where ſinne groweth, there groweth alſo the puniſhment: And he that ſinnes openly with an out-ſtreched necke, as theſe villaines did in <hi>Wiſenburg,</hi> in ſight of God and before the Sunne and the world, they offended double, teaching others by their example to ſinne.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> but how ſoone it came once to his knowledge, he preſently with celerity and quickneſſe of judgment could finde out the contrary remedy, ever to make himſelfe appeare in effect the moſt fortunate Commander that ever we read of. For his great experience in warlike actions did confirme his judgment and his courage; for he was not affraid to doe what he did learne and practiſe before; and like a wiſe Generall, he did ever watch againſt all unlooked for ſtroakes: for nothing could come wrong unto him, becauſe he was alike for all, having had the whole compend of wit in his braines, he could well and wiſely governe the Common-wealth, to fight battailes was his delight; in the making of Leaguers he excelled all other Generalls (as <hi>Tilly</hi> did know) Engines to deviſe, to paſſe over Rivers or Foſſies or walles, was his maſter-peece (as <hi>Tillies</hi> death can witneſſe at the <hi>Leacke</hi>) to plante batteries or to change, therein he was profound; witneſſe alſo his croſſing the <hi>Leacke;</hi> if lines or approaches were to be altered, his judgment then behooved to be uſed; in a word he was the Maſter of Military diſcipline, being riſen from a prentiſe, to the great profeſſor of Arts, in this eminent and high calling of a Souldier: where it is requiſit, that as a man is valorous and judicious, ſo he ought to be conſtant in keeping his word and truth inviolable, as this King did to all his confederats, and to his enemies alſo. And therefore as a
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:132555:130"/>moſt pretious Iewell, his remarkable example of vertue is to be followed by thoſe, who would-prove Heroicke and Magnificent as he was.</p>
               <p>And therefore I was ſerious to prie ſo deepe into his actions, as that thoſe, whom I wiſh to ſucceede him in his vertues, may follow his practiſes uſed in the conqueſt of a great part of <hi>Germany:</hi> for his ſpirit alone and skill in warres was better then thouſands of Armed men. The like gifts I heartily wiſh to my Noble Patron his Highneſſe, the Prince <hi>Elector Palatine,</hi> whom I wiſh to ſucceede him, not only in his vertues but in his conqueſt alſo.</p>
               <p>Seing then the greateſt part of humane happineſſe doth conſiſt in vertue, who ever then would be wiſe, let him fix his eyes and his minde to judge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens actions, thereby to correct his owne, looking unto all that was and is, to th'end that through their example he may learne to better himſelfe; for ſo long he ſhall floriſh, as wiſdome and counſell are his guides, which both I wiſh we may follow.</p>

               <p>HEre we ſee againe his Majeſties wonderfull diligence, wherein doth ever conſiſt the beſt part of warre; for hearing in <hi>Bavaria,</hi> that <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtine</hi> was marched with a ſtrong Armie out of <hi>Bohemia</hi> towards the over <hi>Paltz;</hi> and knowing the Duke of <hi>Baviere</hi> had the paſſe of <hi>Rhineſberg</hi> free unto the upper <hi>Paltz,</hi> he was not able to hinder their Conjunction, if <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtine</hi> his deſigne were on <hi>Nurenberg,</hi> as it was; his Majeſtie knew then dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence was to be uſed for the reliefe of <hi>Nurenberg;</hi> and therefore,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="N"/> though a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, he haſted his march thither; for his Majeſtie knew well, that the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of time in warres was of much importance, eſpecially, knowing the enemies deſigne being on <hi>Nurenberg,</hi> which to have, the enemy he knew, would not ſpare either money or travell; for if they could cut off his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie from the helpe and aſſiſtance of this Towne, it was the beſt way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend <hi>Baviere, Schwabland,</hi> and <hi>Oſtreigh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Likewiſe, it was the onely meanes to recover againe the Biſhopricke of <hi>Wurtzburg,</hi> and the Dukedome of <hi>Franconia,</hi> and by that meanes (if not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together) yet farre they might, drive backe againe his Majeſtie of <hi>Sweden</hi> and his Forces, keeping him out of <hi>Bavaria;</hi> as alſo out of the Emperours hereditarie lands. This was their cunning enterpriſe on <hi>Nurenberg,</hi> and the reaſons of it, which his Majeſtie of <hi>Sweden,</hi> that Heroicke and magnanimous King tooke betimes unto his conſideration; having had a wake-rife or vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant eye over the ſafetie and preſervation of this Citie; ſeeing it ſtood of ſo much importance unto his Majeſtie, and unto the whole <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates, that the enemy ſhould not be Maſter of it. And therefore to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the hurt thereof, his Majeſtie uſed the greater haſte out of <hi>Bavaria.</hi> For his Majeſty knew well, that the opportunitie of time was like a ſwift Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, which being at ones foote may be taken, but when once he mounts in the ayre, he laughs at thoſe would catch him, not meaning to returne unto them: which moved his Majeſtie, not to ſuffer the Eagle to mount ſo high,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:132555:131"/>as to be laughed at, but imbracing opportunitie, while he had it, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the enemies deſigne by taking of time, that augments our experience in warfare; which experience gives us confidence in our behaviours, in the greateſt extremitie, giving us reſolution and courage againſt our enemies; as alſo graces our behaviour towards our friends and confederates.</p>
               <p>Here then we ſee the enemies deſignes prevented by the diligence, labour, and danger of the moſt valiant, the <hi>Lyon of the North,</hi> the invincible King of <hi>Sweden;</hi> who was ſo diligent or wake-rife, that his delight was to try the Concluſions of Fortune againſt his enemies; forcing Fortune to make him her Favourite,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="O"/> and ſometimes her Maſter, as he was on this expedition, in coming betwixt the enemy and the Citie of <hi>Nurenberg,</hi> as a good Shepheard goeth betwixt the Flocke and the Corne.</p>
               <p>Moreover, here we ſee alſo the great wiſedome of his Majeſtie, in making his league and confederacy ſure with the Duke of <hi>Wirtenberg,</hi> before he could perceive the enemies ſtrength that were coming againſt him, taking a catch of time, which being over-ſeene, could never have beene had againe; and therefore it was, that his Majeſtie uſed the greater celeritie in binding up that confederacy, having then his Armie under the Duke of <hi>Wirtenbergs</hi> noſe, to force him to Conditions, if he had not willingly yeelded: where we ſee, that the power of an Armie, led by a King, much availeth to bring inferiours to Conditions, not being able againe to reſiſt a Kings power with Force. And as his Majeſtie was wiſe in making his confederacy with the Duke, ſo he was diligent in fore-ſeeing to write to the <hi>Republique</hi> of <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland,</hi> to get the paſſage cloſed on his enemies behinde him; As alſo we ſee here his Majeſties care to ſupply his Armie, by giving Patents to our Country-men, whoſe fortunes were much to be lamented; for having brought their Regiments ſuddenly together, they were as ſuddenly ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: for both the Colonells being taken priſoners, they were kept pittifully in bondage for the ſpace of three yeares, being neglected of their Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, till they were forced to ranſome themſelves, and Colonell <hi>Iohn For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſſe</hi> having afterwards taken ſervice under the King of <hi>France,</hi> being of ſhort continuance, was much regrated, he being a young Cavalier, free and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall, and of good hope.</p>
               <p>To conclude then this obſervation, it was neceſſitie, that vehement fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,

And therefore it is holden as the beſt teacher, that teacheth all moſt diligently, even Kings as well as meane men, and Armies as well as parties, and parties as private men: for it brings ever great celerity and quickneſſe with it as it did on this our march, for the ſafetie of <hi>Nurenberg.</hi>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to ſee how the end would prove, and who ſhould be thought wiſeſt of both. But you ſhall ſee that he that was at this time the terrour of the world, the ſubduer of <hi>Sweden,</hi> the daunter of <hi>Pole</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:132555:136"/>the hope of <hi>Britaine, Holland</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> was able even unto his death to ſuppreſſe the pride and Tyranny of the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and of his Miniſters and Servants, being all but Novices in warres, in compariſon to the <hi>Lyon</hi> of the North, the invincible <hi>Gnſtavus,</hi> who in glory and dignity did farre ſurpaſſe all his enemies, as is cleered by his former wiſdome, in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his victories, and hereby his great care and diligence in preſerving his friends from the fury of their enemies, exerciſing his Army within a cloſe Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guer, to handle their Armes well, after his owne new diſcipline, being taught to keepe their faces to their enemies in retiring as in advancing, never turning backs on their enemies as of old.</p>
               <p>It is alſo to be admired the great proviſion this City was provided with, being no Sea-towne, as of victualls and Amunition, where it was reported that they had oates, which was diſtributed to the Army, that had bin kept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a hundred yeares, and this City was ever from the beginning re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned for their wiſdome and policy in counſell, more then for their force in Armes, from whence did come the <hi>Dutch</hi> Proverbe, that he who had the wit of <hi>Nurenberg,</hi> the money of <hi>Vlme,</hi> the pride of <hi>Ausburg,</hi> with the power of <hi>Venice,</hi> might doe much in this world.</p>

For his Majeſty knew well when it was time to give a blow, as he did know the ſureſt way to ward and hold off a blow: and we ſee here his Majeſties counſell was of much worth to the good of the City, as his power in Armes; ſo that his very enemies did not only praiſe his wiſdome, but oftimes did admire it, and as the enemy did ſtrive to ſtarve us, his Majeſty knew well, that ſuch a ſtrong Army as they were in the dogge-dayes, lying in the Leaguer in time of ſo great infection, betime would become neere as weake as we were. As alſo his Majeſty knowing the evill that is incident to all Armies through idleneſſe, he preſſed to keepe us ſtill in handling and exerciſing our Armes; for he knew well, mans nature was like Iron, that did ruſt when it was not uſed, and on the contrary, he knew that well exerciſed Souldiers, as he had, would deſire to fight, when Novices (as his enemies had) would be afraid to ſtirre out of their Leaguers: for oftimes it is not the multitude doth the turne, but it is Art begets victory.</p>
               <p>Having ſpoken in the diſcharge of this duty of the actions of ſome wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy perſonages, I minde here to obſerve ſomewhat in commemoration of the perſons worths that did leade them.</p>
               <p>Firſt then we ſee, that the <hi>Spaniard</hi> divers times was forced with little credit to retire out of the <hi>Paltz,</hi> and that in reſpect he never turned faces about in making uſe of ground, Cannon, Pike or Musket: which proves his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treates to have bin diſhonourable, and the Leaders to have bin no Souldiers. For we preſuppoſe, in foure dayes retreat the defender could once have made choiſe of ground, where making uſe of his Cannon, his enemies would be glad they had not advanced ſo farre; but rather that they had ſuffered them to paſſe: but an enemy once feared never fights well, except extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity make him deſperate, and then it is not ſafe to deale with him.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe we ſee here, as they were not all <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that fled,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> ſo they were not all <hi>Swedens,</hi> that followed; ſo that we finde there are ſome good of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:132555:137"/>all Nations: but it is certaine that at ſuch times the worth and valour of a Leader is beſt knowne, not only in fighting examplary to others, but ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in directing others.</p>
               <p>We ſee here, that the turbulent inſurrection of the Boores in <hi>Schwabland</hi> is ſoone ſtilled, when they want a head to leade them, where we ſee, the giddy-headed multitude doth ever wagge like the buſh: for though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they grow pale for feare, they are ſo impudent, that they never bluſh at their faults, though oftimes they are well corrected for their errors.</p>
               <p>Here alſo we ſee, the valour and policy of Duke <hi>Barnard</hi> much to be commended, as a prudent Commander in all his enterprizes, overcoming more by wit and policy, then by dint of Armes. For though reſolution ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver failes, yet by ſtratagems he overcomes more, then by killing; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing victorious he did ſhew his clemency, that another time his enemies might yeeld the ſooner unto him, ſeeing he had uſed theſe well, whom formerly he had ſubdued: and this Cavalier being noble, according to his birth, he knew that the ſtrength of victory conſiſteth in the uſing of it well, which made hime over give the better quarters; for as he was noble, to make him the more noble, he was indued with reaſon; ſo that he conjoined Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with Vertue, which made his worth much eſteemed of, and though he was deſcended of noble Progenitors, yet his minde raiſed him above his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, he being fit to command Armies, and his birth did beget the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt obedience next unto his Majeſty over the whole Army, being reſolute, noble, and prudent withall.</p>
               <p>In the former diſcourſe had of the acts of that noble and worthy Cavalier, though our enemy <hi>Papenhaim,</hi>


                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> his name merits to be inregiſtred, for his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous courage, extraordinary diligence in his expeditions, and the forrunate ſucceſſe, that did accompany his valorous conduct at divers times, even unto his death. This noble Cavalier was ſo generous, that nothing ſeemed difficult unto him, fearing nothing, not death it ſelfe, once reſolved, and as he was valiant, ſo he was moſt diligent in all his expeditions; for while he lived, thoſe Armies next unto him were never ſuffered to ſleepe ſound, which made his Majeſty of <hi>Sweden</hi> eſteeme more of him alone, then of all the Generalls that ſerved the Emperour, wiſhing one day he might rancoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with him, to try his valour, whom he honoured ſo much, though his enemy.</p>
               <p>This valorous Captaine after the Battaile of <hi>Leipſigh,</hi> was the firſt that adventured, with a ſingle Convoy, to paſſe through his Majeſlies Armies, unto the neather <hi>Saxon Creitz</hi> to put life in the cauſe, being come againe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his Majeſty of <hi>Sweden</hi> and home, deſirous to gaine credit, he delaied no time, but on the contrary uſed all diligence, till he got an Army of old Souldiers together out of the Garriſons, and then began to take advantage of his enemies, catching them unawares, like a valiant Captaine and Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, he ſuffered no graſſe to grow where his Army did tread, but traverſed from one place to another, adding and augmenting ſtill to his owne credit, but diminiſhing and ſubſtracting from the reputation of other Generalls, till he obtained the name and fame of the moſt valiant, and moſt vigilant Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall that ſerved the Emperour, being in effect more furious ſometimes in his conduct then requiſit for a Generall, fearing nothing but the indignation of his Superiour, whom he ſerved valianty and truely. This kinde of bould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, though haply it doth proſper for a time, yet ſometimes in others, it
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:132555:137"/>may overwhelme all the good fortune that formerly they attained unto. For nothing is leſſe to be allowed of in a Commander, then bouldneſſe without reaſon, though ſometimes things happen to ſucceed well, being pregnable for ſuch daring men, as the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Papenhaim</hi> was, being both truely couragious. Nevertheleſſe, this daring is not to be made a cuſtome of; ſo being oftimes the example is as faulty, as the deede in an Army.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Papenhaim</hi> in his attempts, ſo farre as I could learne, was unblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in his carriage, as a Leader, except at <hi>Mastreicht,</hi> where he was blamed for too much forwardneſſe with diſadvantage, having loſt more men then the attempt proved credible.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> being ever inconſtant, ſhewing us that good Fortune, Lucke, or chance, as they call it, is never ſtill in one ſide: for his Majeſty that formerly was alike fortunate with few, as with many, here though having a mighty ſtrong Army, he is croſſed, being fruſtrate of his expectation, ariſing by the neglect of a ſmall point of recognoſcing, his Majeſty having truſted too much to others wrong relation, that did not ſatisfie themſelves; which made his Majeſty contrary to his cuſtome ingage his Army, and once being inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon ſlight intelligence, the reliefes went on ſo faſt, the ſervice being ſo hot for a time, that it was long before the loſſe was perceived, where it is to be pittied, that the errour and fault of another ſhould be made to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, as his Majeſties over-ſight, by thoſe that know no better: for though a King leading an Army had <hi>Argos</hi> eyes, yet it is impoſſible he ſhould looke unto all things himſelfe. The fault of one here we ſee with the loſſe of many was irrecoverable, and he that before this day was the terrour of the Empire, by his former ſucceſſe, being deceived with falſe intelligence, is thought to have overſeene himſelfe, the errour of another being imputed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Majeſty in loſing ſo many brave fellowes; which ſhould teach others to be the more circumſpect in recognoſcing, before they ſhould ingage men in bringing them upon the ſhamble-bankes.</p>
               <p>Here alſo we ſee, that his Majeſty was was ever enemy to idleneſſe: for he had no ſooner brought off his Army from purſuing his enemies, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continent he ſets them againe to worke, for their owne ſafeties, and that within reach of his enemies Cannon, to the end it might not be ſaid, but he attended their out-comming, leſt his Army might be diſcouraged at a preſent
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:132555:142"/>Retreate, after ſuch a great loſſe, for if the ſervice had continued, the whole Armie had beene indangered; yet a valourous Captaine, as our Leader was, as he feares nothing entering on ſervice, ſo he ought to ſet light by nothing, he ſees tending to his prejudice, but ought timely to retire, with as little loſſe as he may: for it were a groſſe errour to deſpiſe our enemies through too much confidence in our ſelves; for ſome times by deſpiſing our enemies (as here) we make them the more valiant, and if they be ambitious, the more reſpect we give them,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Y"/> the leſſe we neede to feare them. And it is neceſſarie, when an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie doth get a clappe, as we did here, then incontinent and with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence we ſhould preſſe to trie our enemie againe; whereſoever we can have any advantage, leſt our enemy might judge us altogether to have yeelded and given over, which were very dangerous.</p>
               <p>The bouldneſſe of one bould fellow at firſt, being a Leader may ingage a whole Armie for want of judgement, as was done here going before this hill of <hi>Nurenberg,</hi> where as many were brought in danger, as did tread in the firſt Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders paths, through lacke of judgement, having beene all of them more heady than wiſe; yet to dare being annexed unto vertue is the beginning of victory: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe, a haſty man in an Armie, without judgement and diſcretion, is to be diſallowed of, aſwell as a coward.</p>
               <p>On my Poſte under the Hill, after I was ſhot, a ſudden feare came amongſt the Souldiers, ſome thirtie horſe having ſuddenly come through the wood, as if they had beene chaſed, the moſt part both Officers and Souldiers ranne away, leaving mee with a few number on the Poſte, ſo that if the enemie had fallen out, I could not have eſcaped from being kill'd or taken; but as ſoone as they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that I with the Souldiers remained by me, had unhorſed and taken ſome of the horſemen, who were found to bee friends, they being aſhamed of their miſcarriage retired, having accidentally rencountred with <hi>Hepburs</hi> Captaine Lievetenant, who brought them up againe, whom I threatned to ſhew his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie of their behaviours: nevertheleſſe being loath to incurre the hatred of a brave Nation, for the misbehaviour of ſome unworthy fellowes, their blemiſhes I preſſed to cover: notwithſtanding afterwards ſome of the Officers amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves came to a publique hearing, having blamed one another, till the queſtion and diſgrace was taken away; by ſhewing their particular courage in fighting one againſt another, whereof I kept my ſelf free, ſuffering them to deale amongſt them, being Country-men.</p>
               <p>This kinde of Panicke feare without cauſe doth betray many brave men,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Z"/> and divers good enterprizes. And therfore all good Commanders ought moſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to looke unto it, to avoyde the inconveniences incident unto the like, while as they leade either partie or Armie. Wee once marching through a woode towards <hi>Franckfurt</hi> on the <hi>Oder,</hi> the white Regiment marching in the Van, having a naturall foole, that marched alwayes before them, going within a buſh, throwing off his clothes returning naked, and crying, he had ſeene the enemie, the whole Souldiers of that Briggad throwing downe their Armes, they ranne backe on the next Briggad being <hi>Swedens,</hi> and they running alſo away, till they were holden up with pikes by our Briggad, being the third, who having ſtood, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the reaſon of their running away; in end, being found a falſe, and a fooliſh Alarum, the poore foole was pittifully cut and carved by the Officers, for the Souldiers phantaſticke feare, being a poore revenge for their cowardize, ſo that we ſee by the example of the third Briggad, that the beſt remedie againſt ſuch Panicke feares is not to feare at all; and none ſhould leade Armies, but thoſe that are both wiſe and ſtout.</p>

               <head>The thirty-ſeventh Obſervation.</head>
               <p>THE ſeparation of theſe two mightie Armies was wonderfull,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhot of Cannon, Musket, or Piſtoll, the like we can hardly finde in any Hiſtorie.</p>
               <p>We ſee then here, that when the foundation of mans actions is laid ſure by vertue, the building hardly can faile, eſpecially when we lay our chiefe dependance on <hi>God,</hi> and our cauſe being good, the lawfull meanes uſed (as was done here by the <hi>Lyon of the North,</hi> the Invincible King of <hi>Sweden</hi>) in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of <hi>Nurenberg,</hi> the libertie of <hi>Dutch-land,</hi> and freedome of <hi>Chriſts Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell,</hi> then I ſay, the event muſt needs be anſwerable to the ground laid, to wit, the freedome of this Citie, and the preſervation of his Majeſties Armie, both which we ſee by this ſeparation, where the enemy had not the heart to purſue us, having <hi>Gustavus</hi> and his Fortunes with us; Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of their powerfull and mightie Armie; which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> themſelves did ſet and eſteeme to be threeſcore thouſand men, being then of opinion, that that Summer they were able to over-ſwimme the whole Empire, and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:132555:143"/>all their enemies; yet, with all their bragging, they durſt never preſent themſelves in the Fields, with one Cornet, Colour, or Regiment before <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> being terrified at his preſence, which did prove their valour was not correſpondent to their power in Armes, otherwiſe they had given us greater reaſon to have eſteemed better of their Conduct, ſo that wee ſee, there is neither wiſedome, force, or power of counſell, that can prevaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that cauſe the <hi>Lord</hi> defends; and who can thinke thoſe could proſper better, who formerly preſſed by their crueltie to have ſubverted the truth of Religion; by baniſhing the Goſpell, and Miniſters of it, forcing Commons againſt Conſcience, either to forſake their Country and poſſeſſions, or to renounce the truth they profeſſed, perſecuting thoſe that would not conforme themſelves to their Deviliſh Traditions; what wonder then, thoſe Generalls could not proſper againſt the truth, or againſt him that tooke the defence, both of truth and people, againſt the Tyranny of the houſe of <hi>Austria,</hi> and their cruell Generalls, that were not onely cruell to their enemies, but alſo to their ſervants and Souldiers, whom they left bleeding behinde them in their Leaguer, deſtitute of all comfort; not ſo much as once to cauſe to dreſſe their wounds, that they received honourably for their ſafeties? Truly I dare be bold to ſay, the <hi>Lord</hi> will not ſuffer the negligence and inhumane crueltie of ſuch Commanders to be unpuniſhed, that left unchriſtianly thoſe poore Souldiers, which were bould to open their breſts to receive wounds, for the ſafetie of thoſe that had no compaſſion on them in their extremities. O cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie of all cruelties! when we ſee a valiant Souldier naked, hungry, or pined, with his wounds bleeding for our ſakes, and then to leave them deſtitute of helpe, to the mercy of their enemies, eſpecially, when we are not compelled to leave them! This fault of all faults in a Commander or Souldier, in my minde, is moſt unpardonable, which is too common. Therefore, I conclude,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ſuch perſons to be unworthy Command, that preferre any thing before the health of thoſe, who were willing to give their lives for the ſafetie of their Commanders.</p>
               <p>Sith then we ſee, that the greateſt part of humane happineſſe doth conſiſt in vertue, let him that would prove wiſe, fix his eyes and minde to judge other mens actions, to the end he may grow the more circumſpect and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, preſſing to doe good by continuance of time, if he but obſerve the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties of chances incident unto all eſtates, from the Crowne to the loweſt Cottage, in the end, through their examples, he may learne to better him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and become wiſe in his profeſſion: for a diligent ſervant to ſuch a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter as <hi>Gustavus</hi> was, might in a few yeares time obſerve many things belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to the knowledge of a Commander, though I grant, never attaine unto the perfection of his Calling; for the accidents of warres being infinite, the knowledge of them can never be limited. But we muſt alwayes be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of new things, till we become more prudent, though not perfectly wiſe in our calling, being infinite; and though many thinke a man may be wiſe, and not couragious, ſeeing the wiſe fore-ſees all dangers; truely I will thinke, he that is circumſpect and wiſe in this kinde, may be called a ſtout Commander: for to a wiſe man, we ſay, nothing comes wrong; and he that cannot be ſurprized in this kinde, muſt needs be both wiſe and ſtout.</p>

               <p>IN the diſcharge of the former dutie we ſee his Majeſtie was troubled with a double care;


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Q"/> the one for his <hi>Queene,</hi> the other for his Armie; being diligent in bringing both forwards, as alſo carefull to put them both in aſſurance; for having left the <hi>Queene</hi> at <hi>Donavert,</hi> he marched on <hi>Rhine</hi> to ſubdue his enemies. Where we ſee, that it behooved him firſt to put his <hi>Impedimenta</hi> in aſſurance, teaching thereby Cavaliers, that followed him in time of ſervice, to quit their wives, whereby their care might be the better employed in diſcharging the points of their Calling; which ſhews us, that ſuch impediments at ſuch times were better away than preſent: for our nature is ever to grieve much for the loſſe of things we love. Therefore our care that are Souldiers having wives ſhould be to ſettle them, where they ſhould not be <hi>Impedimenta</hi> unto us, in diſcharging of our duties before our Enemy, to the end we might the better be freed of this double care, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie was ſubject unto at this time, which no queſtion troubled his Majeſties reſolutions more than any thing elſe.</p>
               <p>The tragicall end of this <hi>Dutch</hi> Colonell <hi>Metzlaffe,</hi> ſhould teach all Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers, to whom Strengths are concredited, not to give over without great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie; eſpecially being made fore-ſeene of a Reliefe to come. And the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt blame, that was imputed unto him, was his too much neglect of the duties of his Calling, being too carefull to entertaine Cameradeſhip night and day, the fruit whereof in the end was ignominie, with the loſſe of life and credit. Which ſhould teach all men to avoide ſuch a beaſtly life, diſhonouring the noble profeſſion of Armes.</p>
               <p>We ſee then no law or juſtice is more ſtrict or more ſummary,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="R"/> that the Diſcipline military; where the Articles we are ſworne unto, are our lawes
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:132555:147"/>which being tranſgreſſed, we are ſubject to the puniſhment: and if our lawes were not ſtrict, and our puniſhment ſharpe, it were impoſſible to keepe us in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. But I am ſorry, that for the moſt part we abſtaine more for feare of puniſhment, than for obedience to <hi>God</hi> and the law.

               <p>On this march towards <hi>Saxonie,</hi> all things ſucceeded to his Majeſties de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, as preſages of his enſuing victorie; ſeeing Fortune ſmiled on him, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his liſe time, being Fortunes fellow, he was ſtill incouraged to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, though weakeſt: for magnanimitie and the vertue of true humilitie were both cohabitant in him. For as he had courage with a weake Armie to rancounter a ſtronger; Even ſo he humbled himſelfe before <hi>God,</hi> acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging before the people, he was but duſt and aſhes, like unto other men. And therfore he wiſhed the people they ſhould not truſt or repoſe any thing in him, but to put their truſt and confidence in <hi>God,</hi> ſaying, he was but a ſervant: and though the <hi>Lord</hi> would be pleaſed to take him away from amongſt them, yet, he doubted not, but the <hi>Lord</hi> would raiſe up others more powerfull than he, to defend the good Cauſe he had begunne, till at laſt it were brought to a good end.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſpeeches,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="S"/> and much more to this purpoſe, his Majeſtie out of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie uttered on this march; and as his Majeſtie was humble, ſo his cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie to all men that loved him, was the gemme of his Crowne, eſpecially honouring and reſpecting ever His <hi>Queene,</hi> as the glory of her ſex, his Royall Majeſtie being truely indued with ſuch true ſplendour of noble worth, that he ever ſeemed like unto the Sunne, that ſhineth alike on the Paiſant in the field, as it doth on the Emperour in his Throne.

After this, the other <hi>Swedens</hi> Briggad, or yellow Regiment of the Guard is come after, and not eſteeming of the Graffe in their way, or of the three ſquadrons, or Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes of the enemies foote, being foure times ſtronger than they, which they manfully did beate, making them to give ground, till they were ruin'd, and then on the ſecond time, ſcattering them alſo even untill the third advancing, and being growne weake, and wearie with ſo many brave Charges, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by the enemies third Battaile, which were ſeconded well with two ſquadrons of horſemen, at laſt, with the blew Regiments comming up to relieve them, driven backe, and almoſt ſo ſcattered, that they were ruined, and the ſeven Cannon which formerly they had wonne, were taken from them againe. In the meane time, the <hi>Swedens</hi> ſmall Cannon, that were planted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Briggads, being righted on the enemies Cannon at the winde-mill, whereon alſo Duke <hi>Barnards</hi> Cannon, which were before his Briggad, played on the enemies Cannon towards the wind-mill, doing great hurt to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, ſo that they were forced to retire their Cannon a little behinde the Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars houſe; in this meane time, his Majeſtie with ſome ſquadrons of horſe charged the enemie, that was thrice ſtronger than they, charging with their right wing, his left wing falling on them with ſuch ſurie, that their Reare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard, or reſerve were aſtoniſhed, being ſo furious, that they went through their enemies, putting them to the flight. But eſpecially his Majeſtie himſelfe having charged too farre with foure Cornets in the midd'ſt of the enemies troopes being deadly wonded gave up the Ghoſt, fighting for God and for the defence of the true Religion,

               <p>The Duke of <hi>Fridland Waleſtine,</hi> after the loſing of this Dattaile,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Z"/> retired with his ſcattered Armie towards <hi>Leipſigh,</hi> and having had no time to continue there, he was forced to take his retreate further unto the Hill's of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and thereafter <hi>Leipſigh</hi> was freed from the enemies forces, by the Duke of <hi>Lunenburg,</hi> and the <hi>Saxons,</hi> that were comming with ſuccours unto his Majeſtie before the Battaile, whoſe march was too ſlow, their ſuccours being come but after the ſtroaks were given.</p>
               <p>The Caſtle of <hi>Leipſigh</hi> called <hi>Plaſſenburg</hi> having holden out long, was taken againe, together with which all other partes in <hi>Saxon,</hi> that the <hi>Empertaliſts</hi> had taken, were freed againe, by the <hi>Swedens</hi> the ſecond time, as <hi>Camnits, Fryburg,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>HIS Majeſtie at this time, though a great deale weaker in ſtrength than the enemy, notwithſtanding he was loath to delay time, finding <hi>Waleſtine</hi> once removing from him, <hi>Papenhaim</hi> being alſo abſent with the Armie of the League, his Majeſtie reſolved as beſt to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the occaſion, not giving time to his enemy, either to take more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, or yet to recollect the Forces which were ſcattered from him, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was beſt to deale with one before another, and he knew it was a kinde of madneſſe to ſtay till his enemies Forces were augmented, ſeeing occaſion taken in warres doth often profit more than courage it ſelfe. Therefore we ſee, there was a neceſſitie laid on his Majeſtie to fight this Battaile in time, ſeeing the enemy coming together was twice ſtronger than he, and then his Majeſtie had no place of Retreate within ten miles, which would not onely ruine his Armie, but alſo diſcourage his friends and Confederates, for whoſe reliefe he did come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Waleſtine</hi> retired from his Majeſtie of purpoſe to put off time, till <hi>Papenhaim</hi> had come to him, or till they might draw his Majeſties Army between them, which his Majeſtie fore-ſeeing adventured the Combat, in ſeeking firſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Walestine</hi> before <hi>Papenhaims</hi> coming. It is needleſſe to reaſon more of his Majeſties reſolution, ſince all counſells and adviſements are allowed of, as they happen to ſucceede, which is moſt unjuſt.</p>
               <p>Here alſo we ſee,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="&amp;."/> what a great charge is laid on him that leads an Armie; and of all charges the greateſt is, to fight a Battaile well with a weake Army againſt a ſtrong. Wherein is requiſit a wiſe and a couragious Commander; for when a Battaile is to be fought, it is dangerous for a King, the Head and the Heart of an Armie, with the danger of his whole Armie, to hazard him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and his Kingdome to the deciſion or arbitrement of variable <hi>Fortune,</hi> or to enterprize difficult matters, ſetting all his eſtate in hazard, ſeeing the ſafetie of the whole depends on him alone: for there is nothing more fearfull to a Commander, and with all diligence to be eſchewed, than that he doe not at one time, and one moment, commit his whole eſtate and Kingdome unto the deciſion of Chance, without great advantage offered. Neither ought a King to fight with all his Forces at once, except he could perceive a ſure overthrow to be ſeene cleerely unto himſelfe, or to his enemies, and if then he reſolve to fight, for eſchewing of factions, let one ſupreame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander command, which is ever beſt, ſince many wits in Command doe but breed confuſion. Therefore it is moſt requiſit, that one command and the reſt obey, as was done here at <hi>Leitzen,</hi> and the beſt way of Command is, to keepe men in awe of dutie, not ſo much with crueltie (as many baſe Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls doe) as with a moderate ſevereneſſe: for alwayes Commanders ought to doe, as wiſe Marriners, not to ſteere their courſe ſtill one way, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to give way to the tempeſt, which being paſt, let him follow his courſe
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:132555:149"/>gaine: even ſo wiſe Commanders ſhould moderate their Commands accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the time. For as in a calme ſea any fellow may ſteere, but in a great tempeſt, a skilfull and a wiſe Marriner is requiſit: even ſo in Command, when a Battaile is to be fought, a wiſe and a ſtout Commander is requiſite; for no man can command well, who did not learne to obey. Therefore it is the moſt difficult thing in the world to command well, either our ſelves or others: and he that would command well, muſt not ſhew himſelfe cruell in words or ſtrokes, but if poſſible, he ought to bring men to his minde with intreaty and friendly exhortations, ſhewing himſelfe grave, majeſtique and benevolent, gaining of others his inferiours reverence, feare and munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, with due obedience; and this is the only beſt way to command, and to keepe men in obedience: which qualities were all plentifull in the <hi>Lyon</hi> of the North, the invincible <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> who after this manner incouraged his owne countrimen and ſubjects, to fight, as alſo in a brotherly manner of love incouraged the <hi>Dutch,</hi> being his ſworne ſervants. Who would not obey ſuch a Commander to fight well, being aſſured under his fortunate conduct after travell and paine, to obtaine Glory and honour here, and an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall Crowne after death, for fighting well the Battells of the Lord?</p>
               <p>As his Majeſty went about his enemies with wiſdome and courage:


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ſo <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſline</hi> went about his with craft and policy, caſting a ditch before our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to fall in, which was made the buriall place of his owne Souldiers, being fallen in the ditch they had prepared for others.</p>
               <p>I confeſſe there is nothing more commodious in warre then to deceive an enemy, and oftimes through deceit men obtaine victory: yet the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Gustavus</hi> ſeaſoned with infinite courage could not be trapped with a Fowlers grinne, but brake through it with the aſſiſtance of God, till he was victorious over his crafty enemies.</p>
               <p>This Magnanimous King for his valour might have bin well called the Magnifique King, and holden for ſuch, who while as he once ſaw appearance of the loſſe of the day, ſeeing ſome forces beaten backe, and ſome flying, he valorouſly did charge in the middeſt of his enemies with hand and voice, though thrice ſhot, ſuſtained the fight, doing alike, the duty of a Souldier and of a King, till with the loſſe of his owne life he did reſtore the victory to his eternall credit, he died ſtanding ſerving the publique, <hi>Pro Deo et Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onetuenda;</hi> and receiving three Bullets, one in the body, one in the Arme, and the third in the head, he moſt willingly gave up the Ghoſt, being all his life time a King that feared God and walked uprightly in his calling; and as he lived Chriſtianly, ſo he died moſt happily, in the defence of the truth: and to witneſſe all this was true, I could take Heaven and Earth, Sun and Moone, mineralls &amp;c. to witneſſe that his Colours ever floriſhed and ſpred in the name of the Lord, and that his confidence was not ſet on the Arme of man, though he was a warriour from his youth up, he was the Captaine over <hi>Iraell,</hi> whoſe fingers the Lord taught to fight, and to leade his people.</p>
               <p>He had the heart of a <hi>Lyon,</hi> that by Gods helpe had done ſuch things, that thoſe that had ſeene and heard it as I did, muſt needs have faid, that it was the Lord that did it and not he, being it was the Lords worke. But our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries and their damned crew of Ieſuits and Monkes, will ſay, that it was their power and might, and the goodneſſe of their cauſe, that made his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:132555:150"/>Maieſty to fall. But we may ſay with <hi>Salomon</hi> in the twenty-eighth of the <hi>Proverbs</hi> and twenty-one verſe. <hi>It was for the ſinnes of the Land, and our ſinnes, that he was taken from amongſt us,</hi> and from thoſe poor Cavaliers, that did follow him, for his Maieſtics love, and the love of the cauſe. He was ſhot with three Bullets, dead with the laſt, for our ſinnes and the ſinnes of the Land. And what he did before his death, for the liberty of <hi>Dutch-land,</hi> and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Goſpell none but knowes it: he left his owne Kingdome, to bring ſtrangers to freedome in theirs, he ſet light by his owne life for <hi>Dutch-land,</hi> that they might keepe theirs, he waked and cared day and night for them, as a father for his children, that at laſt he might bring peace for them to ſleepe ſound; he brought the keyes and opened their Church doores that were cloſed up by the Antichriſtian Idolaters, that the Devills doctrine was baniſhed againe out of the <hi>Paltz,</hi> and Chriſts Goſpell preached, and the Sacraments duely adminiſtred, which I ſaw, and was partaker of, ſinging thankes unto God for their deliverance.</p>
               <p>He it was and none other under God,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> who helped them to their liberties, He it was and none other releeved <hi>Iſraell.</hi> Notwithſtanding whereof, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſſe of the people was ſo great, that with my eares, divers times I did heare ſome of them ſay he might as wel have ſtayed in his own country, till they had ſent for him, ſo great was their unthankfulneſſe! Likewiſe they ſaid, if he had had much at home, he had not come unto them over ſeas ſuch a farre Iourney. Was not this to recompence good with evill? Was not this right the chiefe Butlers part, that did not remember <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> but forgot him? Was not this <hi>Ioas</hi> his part to <hi>Ichoida</hi> his Father? O then this was the poiſonable bullet of ingratitude of the people, for which our King and Maſter was taken away! Oh would to God the people had never bin ſo unthankfull, that our King, Captaine and Maſter had yet lived!</p>
               <p>Moreover as theſe people were unthankfull, ſo they were Godleſſe many of them in the time of their troubles, as I did behould oftimes with mine eyes a careleſſe ſecurity amongſt them, thinking their victories were ſo frequent, and their owne power ſo great, they needed not the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Swedens</hi> nor of ſtrangers, and their pride was ſo great, that diſeſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of ſtrangers in their pride, they led a life very inſolent and deboiſt, being given to the workes of the fleſh, adultery, fornication, uncleanneſſe, laſciviouſneſſe, idolatry &amp;c. In a word, it was even amongſt them, as it was in the dayes before the flood, as if the Lord had forgotten them, or could not ſee their villany, ſo it behooved God to have puniſhed them by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties death. For in their hearts they ſaid there was no God; ſo that their miſchiefe came on them unawares; and this the peoples carriage cauſed his Majeſties untimely death, being ſhot the ſecond time. O would to God they had done otherwiſe, and ſerved God more truely, that we might have had the preſence and conduct of our Magnanimous King longer, till the pride of <hi>Austria</hi> had bin more humbled, and the whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> brought unto repentance of her Idolatries! O would to God I could enough lament his death! As alſo lament my owne ſinnes, and the wickedneſſe of the people, that was the cauſe of this untimely death, through their ſinnes! And his Majeſties ſelfe alſo being a ſinner, as he himſelfe oftimes confeſſed, wiſhing that God would not lay to his charge the greate reſpect and reverence the beſt ſort of the people did give unto him,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> being but a ſinfull man, as they were; for which he ſeared the Lord was angry with him; ſhewing by his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſion he
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:132555:150"/>did glory in nothing but in the Lord, aſcribing ever all his victories unto God, and nothing preſuming of himſelfe. For I dare be bould to ſay he was a man according to Gods minde, if there was one on earth. Such was our Maſter, Captaine and King. As was <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of many, ſo was our Maſter, Captaine and King. Was <hi>Noah</hi> in his time unreproveable? So was our Maſter, Captaine and King.

Alas then! it was our ſinnes, and the ſinnes of the Army, and the Land, was the cauſe of our puniſhment in loſing of him, with that unhappy laſt bullet of the three ſhot through his head, who was the head of us all under God our Father in Chriſt, that did undoe us, it was we, I ſay, that ſinned againſt the Lord and his Anointed. It was our miſdeedes did thus grow over our heads that made us loſe our Head and Leader.

The reſt of our Horſemen were directed to Quarters, having left Ordonance Rutters to bring them intelligence.</p>
               <p>The Towne being beleaguered on all Quarters, a Bridge was made over the River, where a ſtrong Guard of horſe and foote were ſent to hinder both their ſupply and eſcape on that ſide. Likewiſe the approaches were begun, and orders were given in haſte for making the Batteries. And the Guards being ſet both to the Cannon, and to thoſe that wrought in the Trenches, the Colonells were Recognoſceing about the walls before their ſeverall Poſtes. Where at the firſt, Colonell <hi>Fowle</hi> was ſhot through the thigh with a Musket,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> who immediatly was ſent to <hi>Ausburg</hi> to be cured.</p>

Spence</hi> his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and mine were appointed to attend on the Generall at his Quarter, my Lievetenant Colonell commanded the Guards on the Battery and the Trenches on our Quarter. And the Generall Major <hi>Ruthven</hi> his Briggad be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the other Quarter next the water, there grew a contreſtation of vertue betwixt the Officers of both Briggads, who ſhould firſt with their approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches come to the wall; but thoſe of <hi>Ruthvens</hi> Briggad were forced, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of their diligence, to yeeld the precedency unto us being older blades than themſelves: for in effect we were their Schoolemaſters in Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, as they could not but acknowledge. So being they were trained up by us from Souldiers to be inferiour Officers, and then for their preferments and advancement they went from us with our favours towards the Generall Major, ſuch as Captaine <hi>Gunne,</hi> Lievetenant <hi>Brumfield,</hi> Lievetenant <hi>Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barre,</hi> Lievetenant <hi>Macboy,</hi> Lievetenant <hi>Southerland,</hi> Enſigne <hi>Denune,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers more, which were preferred under <hi>Ruthvens</hi> Regiment, till in the end they did ſtrive in vertue to goe beyond their former Leaders. Nevertheleſſe we kept ever that due correſpondence together, that where ever we did meet we were but one, not without the envie of others.</p>
               <p>This ſtrife amongſt us furthered ſo the victory, that before the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, from our Battery, where <hi>Sinclaire</hi> did command, there was a breach ſhot in the Skonce without the Towne, as alſo from the Generall Major his Quarter, there were two Officers of the enemies killed on the wall, their Cannon diſmounted, and a great breach made in the wall. So that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my perceiving he had two breaches to defend, he tuck't a Drumme, deſiring to parlé. Which being granted; the Accord went on, and they were ſuffered to march out with their Armes, ſeeing the Generall had intelligence their Armie was comming to releeve them, he was glad to grant them any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, before he were forced to riſe from the Towne by the Enemy, being ſo neare for reliefe of it.</p>
               <p>The enemy being marched out and convoyed away, the Generall directed Generall Major <hi>Ruthven</hi> into the Towne with a ſtrong partie of foote to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet all the Poſts, and then to take notice of all proviſion and goods that were in the Towne; ſuch as Corne, Wine, Artillery, Amunition, Horſes, and all other goods or cadducks in generall, to be uſed at their pleaſure. Which being done, the foote Armie were directed to their former Quarters, to reſt
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:132555:152"/>till further Orders. The Horſemen were directed alſo to Quarters, and then there were Quarters made in the Towne for the Generall and the <hi>Hoofstaffe,</hi> as alſo for the Colonells of horſe and foote, during the Generall his further pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Diverſe of our foote Souldiers were hurt on the Batteries and Trenches, which got Quarters in the Towne, being allowed to have Chirurgians to cure them. And the Towne was incontinent beſet againe with foure Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of Colonell <hi>Hugh Hamilton</hi> his Regiment, being new levied men out of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> and his Major being an <hi>Iriſh</hi>-man, commanded the men. But another <hi>Dutch</hi> Major called <hi>Mountague</hi> was left to Command the Garriſon. Where thoſe that entred firſt the Towne, did make good bootie of horſes and other goods. But the moſt part was ſeazed upon by the Generall <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> taking the benefit unto themſelves, though not the paine. Where we did firſt finde miſſing of our former Leader the invincible <hi>Gustavus,</hi> who not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſpected Cavaliers of merit, at ſuch times, but alſo was ready to reward them by his bountie, allowing <hi>Cadducks</hi> unto them, as he did unto Lievetenant Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell <hi>Gunne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next day a partie of a thouſand Horſe, with eight hundred Musketiers, were commanded out toward <hi>Minchen,</hi> to get intelligence of the Enemies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, getting Orders to fall into their Quarters, if conveniently they could. But beſide their expectation the Enemy being together and in readineſſe in a Wood, unawares our partie was ingaged amongſt them, ſo that with difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie having loſt priſoners, they were forced to retire, and the Enemy getting intelligence that the Towne was given over, to prevent us they continued their march towards <hi>Rhine</hi> on the <hi>Leacke,</hi> to take it in, in compenſation of the loſſe of <hi>Lanſberg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The partie being retired, and the Generall underſtanding the Dukes Army had marched on <hi>Rhine,</hi> he brake up with our Armie, and marched on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide of the <hi>Leacke</hi> towards <hi>Ausburg.</hi> And fearing the Skonce at <hi>Rhine</hi> and the bridge might be taken by the Enemy, he did direct Captaine <hi>Iames Lyell</hi> with two hundred Musketiers as a ſupply to the Skonce, being ordained at his comming thither to take the Command of the Skonce on him. Who being come, finding Colonell <hi>Wornbran</hi> there, ſhewing his Orders, he was made welcome by the Colonell, being hard preſſed by the Enemy, and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily afraid: ſo that the Captaine had no difficultie in getting the command, which he gladly accepted, being more ambitious of credit than of gaines, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppoſit to the Colonels humour.</p>
               <p>The Armie having come in time for the reliefe, our Horſemen were left on the ſide of the River next to <hi>Donavert,</hi> except my Coſen <hi>Fowles</hi> his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which marched over the Bridge with the Infantry, being ordained the firſt nights watch to ſecond the foot. And immediatly after our over-going there were five hundred Musketiers of ſupply ſent unto the Towne, in deſpite of the Dukes Armie. And then we begun to make up our Batteries, and to run our lines of approach towards the Towne, advancing our Redoubts and Batteries, as our approaches were advanced.</p>
               <p>The ſecond night our Batteries being readie,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> there were mutuall interchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Cannonading amongſt us, where Enſigne <hi>Murray</hi> was ſhot dead with the Cannon, his thigh bone being broken, who was much lamented, being a daintie Souldier and expert, full of courage to his very end.</p>
               <p>On Sunday in the afternoone the Enemy having heard certaintie of his
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:132555:152"/>Maieſties death, they drew up their whole Armie, Horſe, Foote and Cannon before the Towne; and rejoycing at the Newes, they gave three <hi>ſalves</hi> of Cannou, Musket, and Piſtoll. Which we not underſtanding, made us admire the more. Nevertheleſſe, the Generall reſolved to get ſome priſoners of them, to cauſe to make an out-fall the next morning: and to that effect, five hundred Commanded Musketiers were ſent under the Command of Lievete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Colonell <hi>Leſly,</hi> who had Orders to fall out before day upon the Enemy. Which he did; and beating them from their Poſts, there were above three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore killed, and thirtie taken priſoners; which revealed the reaſon of their <hi>ſalve.</hi> As alſo by them it was found, the Armie had been broken up at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, and croſſed the <hi>Danube,</hi> having made over a Ship-bridge, thinking with expedition to haſte unto <hi>Saxonie,</hi> to ſupply the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> that were reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring after their defeat at <hi>Leitzen</hi> unto <hi>Boheme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding of the advantage we had to proſecute the Enemy,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> being divided by the River, our Generall would not ſuffer to purſue them, though Generall Major <hi>Ruthven</hi> with the whole Officers offered to doe good ſervice. The Generall fearing they might be brought to fight through deſpaire, he would not permit to follow them, but chooſed rather to loſe a golden oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie.</p>
               <p>Within three dayes afterwards we marched towards <hi>Ausburg,</hi> where we lay two moneths in open Feilds, in the extremitie of cold, without houſes or buildings, which undid the Army being idle without hoſtile imployment, our Generalls giving time to our Enemies to gather ſtrenth to beat us againe out of the Country, which formerly we had ſubdued by his Majeſties valour and good Conduct.</p>
               <p>During this time I remained on my Muſter place at <hi>Webling</hi> Cloiſter, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving out patents to my Officers, and money to recrue and ſtrengthen their Companies. But the enemy having taken-in the Paſſe and Towne of <hi>Lands<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> which was given over upon accord by Colonell <hi>Hugh Hamilton,</hi> who was priſoner, and kept almoſt three yeares; ſo the enemie getting the Paſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Schwabland,</hi> they marched towards <hi>Menning,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi> on the <hi>Eler,</hi> and chaſed mee over the <hi>Danube.</hi> Being forced to quit a good Muſter place, we retired unto <hi>Ausburg,</hi> having ſet the <hi>Danube</hi> betwixt us and the enemie; where, on our march unfortunately my horſe fell on my leg, and being ſix weekes under cure I continued ſtill with the Armie, on all occaſions commanding on horſe-back, being unable to travell a foote.</p>
               <p>The next day after our comming to <hi>Ausburg,</hi> Generall <hi>Bannier</hi> did breake up with the Armie to march towards <hi>Vlme</hi> on the <hi>Danube,</hi> there to joyne with the Felt-marſhall <hi>Gustavus Horne,</hi> who was to come with a ſtrong partie of horſe, foot, and Artillerie from <hi>Elſas,</hi> with whom was come Major <hi>Sidſerfe,</hi> and the whole Musketiers of Sir <hi>Iames Ramſey</hi> his Regiment; who being valou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and expert old Soldiers, they were commanded on all exploits of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, being conducted and led by a diſcret Cavalier their Major.</p>
               <p>The enemie, before our joyning with the Felt-marſhall, had taken in <hi>Landsberg, Kaufbeyre, Kempten</hi> and <hi>Menning</hi> where their Armie did lie, while as we joyned with the Felt-marſhall at <hi>Vlme.

At which time the Rex-chancellour <hi>Oxeſtern</hi> made offer, after his Majeſties death, to the Duke of <hi>Saxon,</hi> to be made and choſen Directour of the Armies; who was neither willing to accept it himſelfe, nor yet willingly would condeſcend to be dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by any other; ſo that their diviſion did by timefully ruine the Armie, and almoſt loſt the good cauſe, few or none looking to the weale of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, but all pleaſing their owne fancies, ſuffering the enemie to take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, every one looking to their particular commodities, which did oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion the meeting at <hi>Hailbrun.</hi>

               <p>We ſee alſo there is nothing more dangerous for Commanders in warres,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="N"/> then to be thought once by their fellowes, Officers and Souldiers to be greedy of the evill of gaine: which opinion once received by inferiours, may mightily croſſe the fortunes of their Leaders: for when Officers and Souldiers conceive an evill opinion of their Leaders, no eloquence is able to make them thinke well of them thereafter; for, a ſupreme Officer being once remarked to keepe the meanes of thoſe that ſerved them, they are without doubt thereafter deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by their followers. And therefore he is never worthy the name of a glorious Commander, that doth not preferre the vertue of liberalitie before the love of periſhing gold; otherwiſe in his teeth he will be aſwell deſpiſed by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Soldiers, as by his betters; for a brave Commander ought never to make an Idol of the moneys which ſhould ſatisfie Souldiers, but he ſhould rather looke unto that which may follow, to wit, his overthrow, or at leaſt his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. Therefore I would adviſe Cavaliers, that command and leade others, to entertaine the affection of thoſe that have ſerved bravely and truly, leſt being unjuſtly diſdained, they might turne their Armes the contrary way.</p>

               <p>After his Majeſties death we ſee the alteration of time did give greater advantage unto our enemies; for while as our Army lay idle the whole winter at <hi>Ausburg,</hi> the enemy was gathering his forces, and we loſing time neglected our duty, having loſt our Head and Leader, when we ought rather to have followed our enemies with fire, ſword, ſpoile and ſlaughter, till we had ſubdued them, than to have ſuffered the enemy before our noſes to have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from us that, which we by his Majeſties good conduct had conquered before, So that we ſee it is viciſſitude that maintaines the world: and as one ſcale is not alwayes in depreſſion, nor the other lifted ever higher; even ſo, like unto the alternate wave of the Beame, we were at this time with both our Armies kept ever in the play of motion.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="W"/> that the ſpirit and skill of one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander is ſometimes better than thouſands of armed men. And nothing encourages an Enemy more than the fooliſhneſſe and ignorance of their Enemies in warlike buſineſſe: But on the contrary, he ſleepes not ſound that hath a wiſe enemy. For a wiſe Leader doth all things wiſely, and it becomes not a Leader to uſe himſelfe to vanitie, or to intemperate appetites, for, how
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:132555:155"/>can he command others, that never preſſed to command his owne inordinate deſires? and brave Leaders of Armies and valourous Captaines ſhould ever looke to their honour and renowne, more than unto riches or pleaſure, ſpoyle or gaine, quitting the ſpoyle of their Enemies to their Souldiers, they ought to reſerve the honour and fame for themſelves: for, he wants not meanes but inriches his family, that hath wonne credit, and leaves it to his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. Our conteſtation then ſhould be for honour and credit, and not for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull ſpoyle or gaine, eſteeming more of magnanimitie, where ever it is found, than of riches attained unto; it may be, through feebleneſſe and cowardice, lying in a Garriſon, having never ſeen an enemy, or a man killed in the Fields; when other Cavaliers did ſhew their valour before their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, gaining more credit, though leſſe wealth, which is of ſhorteſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance. For we are not worthy the name of Souldiers, if we glory (as many doe) more in gathering riches (that periſh faſter than they come) than we doe to get an immortall good name: for we muſt thinke ſtill, that true honour doth conſiſt onely in vertuous actions, which ſhould make us more ambitious of credit, than of unlawfull gaine attained unto by avarice.</p>
               <p>Here alſo we ſee great difference betwixt Leaders;


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> For after we had gotten Feltmarſhall <hi>Horne</hi> to leade us, we began by his valourous good Conduct to recover againe, what others had ſuffered the Enemy to poſſeſſe: and before he advanced, he made his friends ſure behind him, as <hi>Vlme,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Vertenberg,</hi> that alwayes in neceſſitie he might make a ſafe retreate, as a wiſe Generall ought to doe, looking what might happen. So then we ſee, that as Reſolution is needfull, Counſell is not to be deſpiſed coming from a ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt minde; for it is better to ſave our ſelves and others, than to be the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments to loſe both. But when we have no time to reſolve long in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters deplorable, then reſolution ſhould have place before long adviſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Here alſo I did obſerve, that Generalls are forced to be ruled according to the occurrences in warre. For the Feltmarſhall thinking to get advantage of the enemies Armie, he left the Garriſon of <hi>Memming</hi> behinde him; For he knew well, if once he did beate or remove the enemies Armie, he could deale the eaſier with the Garriſon in ſubduing of it. Moreover, we ſee here, how neceſſary Cannon are to a Generall to make a ſafe Retreate, getting any advantage of ground.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe we ſee here the goodneſſe of Intelligence,


<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Y"/> which is ever moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to an Armie, without which no good can be done or effectuated. Which made the Feltmarſhall quit the gaining of <hi>Kempten,</hi> to ſave the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Vertenberg</hi> by his diligence and celeritie, in marching to gaine the paſſe before the <hi>Imperialists.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the other part, ſloath and neglective watch is to be condemned, while as through ſecuritie Cavaliers ſuffer themſelves to be ſurpriſed, as became of the <hi>French</hi> Marqueſſe and Colonell <hi>Iohn Forbeſſe,</hi> being both taken in their beds, who ought rather, through good Intelligence, to have been on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe in the Fields before the Enemies comming.</p>
               <p>Alſo the valour of thoſe Cavaliers that made the Retreate good, is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy praiſe, they having carried the tokens of their valour in their bodies, for the ſafetie of their Camerades.</p>

               <p>My Coſen <hi>Fowles</hi> being ſhot in the foot, retired to <hi>Vlme</hi> to be cured, who through the ſmart of his wound fell into a languiſhing Feaver: and as the wound was painfull to the body, ſo the ſinfull body was painfull to the ſoule, the body being endangered except the wound were cured, and the ſoule was not ſound till the bodies ſinne were healed, and both for ſix weekes did much ſmart the patient, while as his wounds were dreſſed. But though his bodily wound was incurable, yet his ſoule was cured by the puniſhment of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. For, all the time, he like to a good Chriſtian, made himſelfe night and day familiar by prayers unto <hi>God,</hi> till he found reconciliation through Chriſt. So that his end was glorious, having long ſmarted under correction, though his life was painfull.</p>

His life was his walke, Chriſt his way, and Heaven his home. And though during his life time his pilgrimage was painfull, yet the world knowes, his way did lead to perfection: for he leaned ſtill on Chriſt, in whom he was made perfect. And therefore let no man doubt, that though his end was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, but his home was pleaſing, being by his brethren after death made wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to Heaven: and though he travelled hard, yet I perſwade my ſelfe he walked right, and therefore was rewarded and made welcome through <hi>Chriſt</hi> his Redeemer.</p>

            <p>Twelve Companies thus complete would make up three Squadrons, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Squadron of Pikes and Muskets being drawne up ſeverall apart, after the former example of the leſſe body, Pikes and Colours on the right hand, and the Musketiers on the left, which three Squadrons thus drawne up and complete would make a complete Briggad of Foote, to be divided as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes (<hi>viz.</hi>) eight Corporall-ſhips of Musketiers, being thirty-two Rots divided in foure Plottons, every Plotton being eight in front, led off by a Captaine, and every Diviſion after him led up by a ſufficient Officer, till at a haulte all were drawne in even front, after this Diviſion ſhould follow the thirty-ſix Rots of Pikes, being twelve Corporall-ſhips with their Colours, a Captaine leading off the firſt five Rots before the foure Colours ſhould ſtirre, where betwixt the ſecond and third Ranke of the firſt Diviſion of Pikes, the Drummer ſhould beate, then the Enſignes ſhould leade off the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diviſion, their Furers with their Colours following them, till they drew up in even Front with the firſt Diviſion of Pikes, which ought to be in one Front with the thirty-two Rots of Musketiers, that make the right wing of the Briggad, keeping their Armes orderly ſhouldered, till they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded otherwiſe, and their Sergeants ought to looke unto the Flanks, till ſuch time that the whole Squadron of Pikes being thirty-ſix Rots were drawne up in even Front with the Musketiers, after this manner, the other Squadron of Pikes being thirty-ſix Rots alſo, which ſhould make the Battaile of the Briggad, ought to march by Diviſions, being led up in all reſpects and order, after the manner of the former Squadron of Pikes, till they were in even Front with the reſt, then the other thirty-two Rots of Musketiers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to that Squadron, which are appointed to be the Battaile of the Brig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gad, ought to be led up as the firſt Diviſion of Musketiers were in all points, which ought to draw up at a reaſonable diſtance behinde their owne Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron of Pikes, appointed for the Battaile of the Briggad: where their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants on the Flancks ought to looke to their order, and not to ſuffer them to ſtirre their Armes, till they were commanded.

               <p>HAving thus formed a Company, and ſhowne the manner to draw up a complete Briggad, for the younger Officer his better underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, being a Novice to this Diſcipline, I will ſet downe briefely the beſt way, ſuddenly to bring a young Company to be exerciſed, which in my opinion would be thus. Firſt, ſince every Rot of the twenty-one, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Company doth conſiſt, hath allowed a Corporall or a Rot-maſter as the Leader of the other five, which Leader is ſuppoſed to be more expert in handling of Pike or Musket, then the other five, who make up the Rot, and the under Rot-maſter is ſuppoſed to be more expert in handling his Armes than the other foure, ſo that he is appointed as a ſecond to the Leader, being ſometimes a Leader himſelfe, then after the company is made up, for the firſt weeke I would have every Corporall of the ſix, and the fifteene Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters, being Leaders, with the helpe of their under Rot-maſters, in a weekes time, to make the other foure as expert in handling of Pike and Musket, as themſelves, or to be puniſhed with Irons in caſe of their neglect, which the Sergeants ſhould ſee done, as they ſhould anſwer to the Lievetenant, the Lievetenant to the Captaine, and the Captaine to the Major, the Major to the Lievetenant Colonell, and they all to the Colonell, which they ought to practiſe in the fields apart, till the Rot were acquainted, every one with his Leader, from the firſt to the laſt: and while as the under Rot-maſter ſhould turne Leader, then all the followers before, were then Leaders alſo, and then the Rot being apart, the middle man of the Rot ſhould be taught to double to the Front, till their deepe were three, that was ſix before, and in falling off againe, the middle man ſhould turne to the contrary ſide or hand he came up upon, carrying their Armes handſomly free from others,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:132555:159"/>without making noiſe in their retiring to their former ſtation, and orders.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe I would have the Corporall, Rot-maſter or Leader, being a Musketier, having his Rot once expert, in handling ſeverally the Musket well, then to diſcharge their Muskets in winning ground, advancing to an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, the Leader having diſcharged his musket, ſtanding ſtill to blow his panne and prime againe, having caſt off his looſe powder, then to caſt about his Musket to his left ſide, drawing backe with his Musket his left foote and hand, till the mouth of the musket come right to his hand, to charge againe in the ſame place, ſtanding firme till his follower marched by him on his right hand, ſtanding at the ſame diſtance before him, that he ſtood behinde, and then to give fire, blowing his pan, priming, caſting off and retiring his musket with his left hand and foote, and to charge againe, as is ſaid, and ſo forth, one after another, diſcharging at a like diſtance, till at laſt the Rot-maſter ſhould be under-rot, and the under-rot Leader, and then his follower marching up by him, while as he is charging, giving fire on the enemy, and having diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſtanding ſtill alſo charging, till in th'end, the Rot-maſter come to be Leader againe, and ſo forth, ſtill advancing <hi>per vices,</hi> till the enemy turne backe, or that they come to puſh of Pike, and Buts of Muskets. Thus having exerciſed the Rots apart for a weeke or two, doubtleſſe they will become ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Souldiers in uſing their Armes, when they are joyned in a ſtrong body, leſſe or more. The Pike-men would be exerciſed alſo by Rots apart, in the ſeverall Poſtures thereof, till they were acquainted alſo with their Leaders, and were made expert in uſing their Pikes aright, till thereafter the whole body of Pikes might be exerciſed apart, with great eaſe to their Officers; The Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketiers being drawne in a body, being ſixteene or thirty-two men in Front, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but ſix Rancks deepe, the firſt Rancke diſcharging at once, caſting about their muskets and charging all alike, the ſecond Rancke marches through every follower, going by on the right hand of his Leader, ſtanding before him at the diſtance they were behinde, and then being firme, they give fire all alike on their enemies, blowing, priming, caſting about and charging all alike where they ſtand, till <hi>per vices</hi> the whole Ranckes have diſcharged, and ſo forth <hi>ut antea,</hi> ſucceſſively advancing and giving fire, till the enemy turne backe, or that they come to puſh of Pike, and being thus well exerciſed in advancing to the enemy, and winning ground, if through neceſſity they be forced to retire from an enemy, loſing ground, they muſt alſo keepe their faces to their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, the Reare being ſtill in fire, and the laſt Rancke having given fire, they march through the Rancks till they that were laſt are firſt comming off, and ſo <hi>per vices,</hi> till they have made a ſafe retreate, the Reare which is ever the Front, coming from an enemy is in fire.</p>

               <head>The manner to exerciſe a body of Musketiers.</head>
               <p>TO exerciſe a Squadron of Musketiers, how ſtrong ſoever they be, the number of Rancks being no deeper than ſix, the files being even may be ſo many as your voice can extend to, ever obſerving that your Command be given in the Front, otherwiſe may breede diſorder, and before you begin to command, you would enter firſt with a Prologue, as good Orators commonly doe, to reconciliat their hearers attendance: even ſo you ought with an exhortation of attendance entreate, but by way of command, your Souldiers not to be gazing in time of their exerciſe, but with ſtedfaſtneſſe to ſettle their mindes on their exerciſe, that they may the better obſerve and obey the words of command; and above all things, you are to command them to keepe ſilence, not babling one to another, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their motions, to ſuffer their Armes to rattle one againſt another, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to take heede to their Leaders, that goe before them, and to follow them orderly without diſturbance, keeping and obſerving their due diſtance either of Ranckes or Files: which may be eaſily done, if they but duely fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their Leaders, and have an eye on their right and left fellow Camerades, for keeping their Ranckes even in a like Front. Likewiſe they are to obſerve when they are commanded to turne any where, whether it be by Rancks or Files, that their faces may by turned to the hand they are commanded to, before they ſturre to march, and then to march alike, and when ever they double Rancks or Files, or counter-march, they muſt ever obſerve to retire to the contrary hand, they were commanded to double on, if they doubled to the right, when they fall off they retire turning to the left hand, <hi>et contra,</hi> for avoiding of diſorder or hinderance, that their Armes would make, if they retired to the ſame hand they were commanded to double or march to; In their counter-marches it is alſo requiſit in time of exerciſe, that neither Officer nor Souldier doe preſume to command, direct, or finde fault with the errour, but he that commands in chiefe, whether he be ſuperiour or inferiour Officer for the time, ſince it is ſaid, when many ſpeake few heare; Therefore he muſt command alone, ſuffering no rivall, for avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of diſorder. Order therefore of diſtance being a chiefe point obſerved in exerciſing is three fold, to wit, Open order of Rancks or Files is ſix foote of diſtance, being betwixt Rancks and Files both alike, only requiſit to be obſerved in muſtering, or while as they ſtand in danger of Cannon, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in battaile, where in battaile order the diſtance to be obſerved betwixt Rancks or Files ſhould be three foote, where Elbow to Elbow of the ſide Camerades may joyne, where in the open order aforeſaid, hand to hand can but joyne. But in cloſe order uſed moſt in converſion, or wheeling is ſhoulder to ſhoulder, and foote to foote, firme keeping themſelves together, for feare to be put aſunder by the force of their enemies, and then to diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which is ever to be looked unto, chiefely before an enemy. Your ſpeech thus ended, for your generall directions, you begin againe to command ſilence, and to take heed what is commanded to be done, ſaying. Height
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:132555:160"/>your Musketiers, dreſſe your Rancks and Files, to your open order of ſix foote, and take heede.

               <p>All that doubled, turne firſt about, and then they retire falling behinde thoſe were their Leaders, before in the ſame place or diſtance. This dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of the bringers up or of middle-men, is very requiſit in giving a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>ſalve</hi> of Musket, and as it is to be obſerved in rancks, that the beſt men are placed in front, reare and middle, even ſo in files, every Corporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip being foure files of Musketiers, the likelieſt are put ever in the right and left files of the foure, being alſo of beſt experience.</p>
               <p>The doubling of rancks being done, and all remitted in good order, and to their firſt diſtance of open order, you are to command, and exerciſe Souldiers in three ſeverall wayes of counter-marching, requiſit in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, but in my opinion to be uſed but ſeldome, except it be in neceſſity in ſuch parts, as the ground will not permit otherwiſe, therefore to avoide diſorder, Souldiers ought not to be ignorant of any of the three ſorts of counter-marching.</p>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:132555:160"/>
               <p>Firſt having commanded the Souldiers to dreſſe their rancks and files, and to carry their Muskets handſomly keeping ſilence, ſay.
<q>
                     <l>To the right hand the counter-march without noiſe or loſing of ground.</l>
                     <l>To the left hand retire againe to the former ground.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Then command againe to dreſſe rancks and files, and to right their Armes keeping ſilence, taking heede to what is to be commanded, and ſay.
<q>To the right hand turne.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Then the Flancke before being now the Front command,
<q>
                     <l>To the right hand counter-march and loſe no ground.</l>
                     <l>To the left hand as you were.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This is uſed ordinarily to change one wing of Battaile in place of the other, then that the Front may be as it was firſt before they Countermarcht.
<q>To the left hand turne, dreſſe your Rankes and Files, and be ſilent.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Another ſort of Countermarch is the <hi>Slavonian</hi> countermarch, where you loſe ground, the Front being changed alſo: then you command the firſt Ranke to turne about to the right hand, then you ſay to the reſt,
<q>Countermarch, and through to your former distance after your Leaders,</q>
               </p>
               <p>Then ſay, <hi>Leaders as you were;</hi> and to the reſt:
<q>To the left hand countermarch as you were to your firſt ground.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The third ſort of countermarch I eſteeme moſt of to be practiſed, being rather a converſion very requiſit to be well knowne to all Souldiers in all Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, chiefly to be uſed before an enemy: for as it is moſt ſudden; ſo in my opinion, it breeds leaſt diſorder and diſturbance, the Souldiers once uſed to it, of themſelves they will willingly doe it on any occaſion, the body being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in open order or Battaile order, ſay. Cloſe the Ranks and Files to your cloſſe order, without encumbering one of another, every man following right his owne Leader, keeping cloſſe to his ſide man, then ſay. To the right hand the quarter turne halfe or whole, as the occaſion and the ground doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and then ſay. Dreſſe your Armes, and follow your Leaders, and open a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to your Battaile order.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the body of your Musketiers exerciſed perfectly after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, for the better bringing of them in exerciſe and breath, that in caſe any diſorder may happen amongſt them, they may the better afterward be acquainted one with another, ſay to your open order of ſix foote diſtances. Open both Rankes and Files, and ſet downe your Armes handſomely where you ſtand, then command your Sergeant to goe an hundred paces from the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:132555:161"/>body of your Musketiers, and ſticke in his Holbert in the ground, then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh your Souldiers, that at the tucke of your Drumme they runne from their Armes about the Holbert, and to ſtay there till the Drumme recall them againe to their Armes, which being done, it makes the Souldiers able in breath to know one anothers place, in caſe they ſhould be brought at any time in diſorder, to recover themſelves the better. Thus much for the training of Souldiers in changing of place, as you will have them, without giving of fire.</p>
               <p>When you have gotten your Souldiers thus experimented in their moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then are you to acquaint them with ſhot in giving of fire, to make them fix againſt their enemies, which is eaſily done, having once apart and ſingular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed their Muskets, after the order of the ſeverall poſtures, belonging there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, as was commanded their inferiour Officers and Leaders to teach them before they were exerciſed. Therefore before you come to the particular formes of giving fire, you ſhall firſt give ſome generall directions to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by all, for avoiding the hurting of themſelves, or of their Camerades, as alſo how they can beſt offend their enemies; and to this effect, you ſhall admoniſh in love all brave Musketiers, firſt to have their Muskets cleere and hanſome, and above all fix in the worke, eſpecially every Souldier would be well knowne with his owne Musket and cocke, to cocke aright, then to hold the mouth or Cannon of his Musket ever high up, either being on his ſhoulder, or in priming or guarding of his panne, but in giving fire, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver higher or lower than levell with the enemies middle, then your Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketiers being in readineſſe, your Muskets charged, they may be comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to give fire in skirmiſh, diſbandoned as their Officers doe direct them, to advance or retire, as the occaſion offers; alſo to give fire by Ranckes, Files, Diviſions, or in <hi>Salves,</hi> as the Officer pleaſeth to command, to the effect they may be fixed <hi>Omni modo,</hi> though in my opinion, one way is the beſt, yet there are ſeverall wayes of giving fire in advancing to an enemy, as retiring from an enemy, or in ſtanding firme before an enemy, either by Rancks, or by Files made to Rancks.</p>
               <p>Advancing to an enemy not being diſbandoned, but in one bodie they give fire by Rancks to Rancks, having made readie alike, they advance ten paces before the bodie, being led up by an Officer that ſtands in even Front with them, the Cannon or mouth of their Muskets of both Rancks being paſt his bodie. The ſecond Rancke being cloſe to the backe of the foremoſt, both gives fire alike, priming and caſting about their Muskets they charge againe where they ſtand, till the other two Rancks advance before them, and give fire after the ſame manner, till the whole Troope hath diſcharged, and ſo to beginne againe as before, after the order of the through-counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>march; ever advancing to an enemie, never turning backe without death, or victorie. And this is the forme that I eſteeme to be the beſt: as for the reſt, they are not to be much uſed; but this order can be uſed winning ground, advancing or loſing ground in a Retreate. When you would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the body of your Musketiers to give fire in a <hi>Salve,</hi> as is ordinarie in Battell, before an enemy joyne, or againſt Horſemen; then you command the bringers up or Reare to double the Front to the right hand, and to make readie, having the match cocked and their pannes well guarded, having cloſed the three Rancks, though not the Files, the Officers ſtanding in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall Front with the foremoſt Rancke, betwixt two Diviſions, he commands
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:132555:161"/>to give fire, one <hi>Salve,</hi> two or three, and having charged againe, and ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered their Armes, they retire to the left hand againe, every man falling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde his owne Leader.</p>
               <p>Being on retiring from the enemie, the whole bodie having made readie, as they march off in order, a qualified Officer being in the <hi>Reare,</hi> and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Officers in the <hi>Van</hi> to order them that fall up, the laſt two Rancks in the <hi>Reare</hi> turne faces about, and the whole body with them, and the two Rancks having given fire, they march through the body to the <hi>Van,</hi> and order themſelves as they were before, and ſo ſucceſſively the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die gives fire ever by two Rancks, and falls off till ſuch time as they have made their Retreate ſure. Thus much of fire-giving by Rancks on two or three, as you pleaſe, at once and no more.</p>
               <p>Now a little for the exerciſing of the Squadron of Pikes in generall; for the generall motion certaine directions are to be obſerved concerning Pikes, that the Souldiers keepe their Pikes cleane and cleere, and never to be ſuffered to cut off the lengths of their Pikes, as often is ſeene upon marches, being very uncomely to ſee a Squadron of Pikes not of one length; likewiſe in all motions with the Pike, the hand and foote ought to goe alike, and the Souldier would be expert in giving the right pouſſe with the Pike backwards and forwards. Your Squadron of Pikes as they ought to march with the Drumme; ſo they ought to obey the Drumme beating a Troope, a Charge, a Call, a Retreate. As alſo to traile their Pikes, to make reverence with the Pike being ſhouldred: and your Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron of Pikes being but ſix deepe in Rancke, your Files may be ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as can well heare your voyce in Command, providing there be no odde File; and thus well ordered at their open order of ſix foote diſtance, command to mount their Pikes, then calling for a Drumme beſide you, let him beate a march, then they are to ſhoulder their Pikes, flat or ſlaunt carried, and then to march a little, let your Drumme againe beate a Troope, then they mount their Pikes and troope away faſt or ſlow, as your paſſe leades them ſtopping, or advancing as you doe, then let your Drumme beate a Charge, then they charge their Pikes and advance faſt or ſlow, as you lead them, and retire alſo backwards, their Pikes charged as you will have them, then troope againe, and they mount their Pikes, march and ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and haulting, let the Drumme beate againe, and they order their Pikes on the ground as firſt, being at their diſtance, and trooping againe they mount their Pikes, ſo that you can command them to Battell order or cloſſe order, for Wheeling or Counter-marching at your owne plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
               <p>In repayring to their Colours, or comming from watch, they ſhould ever walke with their Pikes mounted, as alſo they may uſe this poſture on Contrie; and your Pikes mounted and at your open order, you can uſe all doublings that your Musketiers uſed, as alſo to preſent, to Front, Reare, right or left hand, the curioſitie of the turnes to the right or left hand in <hi>Van</hi> or <hi>Reare,</hi> the Pike being ſhouldred, you can alſo teach them, as you will, though not much to be uſed in exerciſe: and the Pikes thus well exerciſed, having ſeene frequent danger, can doe good ſervice againſt Horſemen and againſt foote to foote, either in battell entering a Towne or breach, or retiring, or advancing to choake an enemie, on walls within
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:132555:162"/>Townes or Forts they are very commodious for ſervice, providing they reſolve to fight well and to abide by their Officers, and, in my opinion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well led they may beate Musketiers accidently off the Feild, and being well lined with ſhot they are a ſafeguard againſt Horſemen, having the leaſt advantage of ground. Thus much in briefe for the uſe of the Pike, the moſt honourable of all weapons, and my choice in day of battell, and leaping a ſtorme or entering a breach with a light breſt-plate and a good head-piece, being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded with good fellowes, I would chooſe a good halfe-Pike to enter with.</p>

For after his Majeſties death, what puniſhment was to be ſeene in our Armie? none at all: when our owne horſemen plundered their friends not being puniſhed, they began to intercept Letters, and to robbe the common Poſte, and to hinder the Countries correſpondencie, and common traffique: which being overſeene, and winked at by our Generalls, they begun then to plunder the Chancelours owne waggons, abuſing his ſervants, and taking his baggage: thereafter the ſtrongeſt amongſt themſelves ſet the weakeſt party to foote, taking away their horſes, till at laſt the whole Armie refuſed to obey the <hi>Director</hi> and his <hi>Concilium formatum,</hi> lying idle for three moneths in <hi>Donavert</hi> Leaguer, ſuffering the enemie to over-runne the Countrie, and all becauſe that the Officers alleadg'd after his Majeſties death, that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veners who followed the Chancelour, were in better eſteeme, than the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers, that had done notable good ſervice unto his Majeſtie: ſo that, through this jealouſie, the Armie came in diſorder, being the firſt change, and the reſt, piece and piece did follow, till at laſt the whole Armie was loſt, through the number of wrongs that went before, in the end cuſtome and uſe of wrongs infected the nature it ſelfe, and the lacke, or want of puniſhment, and the libertie and freedome, which was given to offend, at laſt the ruine of families, that were famous did follow, for not puniſhing of ſinne.

Yet injuries doe ever ſticke neerer unto us, then the remembrance of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits received: for in remembring of benefits, wee aſcribe the good to our owne merits, flattering our ſelves; but on the contrary, remembring our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries received, we call them to minde a great deale more cruelly, than they were done without moderation. I muſt then adviſe my friend, that he not only prevent the deede of his enemy, but alſo his counſells, leſt they bring detriment upon him: for he ought to be a like with the offer of an injury be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Cavalier, and with the intention, as if the deede had followed. The offering then of a ſtroke may be repaired with a ſword, the giving of a lie is repaired with a blow, words not tending to diſgrace are repaired with words againe, the loſſe of goods is reſtored by reſtitution, with circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances convenient, and to quarrell for a light occaſion is want of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, eſpecially with thy betters in eſteeme. For there ſhould be had reſpect of perſons, of times, and of circumſtances obſerved, before a man ſhould quarrell; and having once quarrelled, I would adviſe my friend not to be put backe without honourable ſatisfaction, or at leaſt great hazard, not coming unto the fields for the firſt bout, or bloud, and then to returne with
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:132555:166"/>diſgrace unthought of by thy ſelfe, though much by others, as I have knowne Cavaliers doe.</p>

               <head>A ſhort obſervation of Jntelligence, neceſſary for a Commander.</head>
               <p>COnſhaft or Intelligence in an Army is ſo neceſſary, that without it no direction can be given with aſſurance, without it we cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne betwixt our friends and our enemies, who are with us, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, which is the firſt point a Commander hath to know; comming in an enemies country: Next he ought to know the ſtrength of his enemies Army, foote and horſe, that he may the better diſpoſe of his owne: he ought alſo to know how his enemy is quartred in Garriſon, Leaguer, Field or Dorpe, and what watch they keepe in all thoſe parts: And how farre their horſmen doe lie from their foote, and how guarded. To have certainty of all this he muſt have ſome ſecret friend with the enemy, for giving him ſecret intelligence, and that he ſhould not truſt too much in one, he muſt have a ſubtill Boore, now and then frequenting without ſuſpition amongſt them, as ordinarily his Majeſty of worthy memory had: likewiſe it were needfull that they deboiſhed ſome Secretary on their ſide, for getting the Liſts of their Strengths, Officers and Souldiers, as alſo for their qualities, that he might the better diſpoſe himſelfe againſt them, in directing private parties on the wayes they travell to get priſoners, and failing thereof to fall on their watch or within their quarters.</p>
               <p>He ought alſo on all marches to have a knowne Boore with him, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him with all paſſes or ſtraights, on which the enemy can repare to him, or from him, conferring his land mappe with the Boores intelligence, which betime would enable him in knowing all the Paſſes.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe he ought to have intelligence out of the enemies Leaguer, how they were provided of victualls, Amunition or forrage, and of their healths, if there were any infections amongſt them, or what ſport or recreation they uſed without their quarters, and what ſtreetes they goe on, and how they are conveyed, ſtriving ſtill to get priſoners, for the better intelligence how their Amunition is kept, and with what Guards, that if it were poſſible, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident all fire might be ſet to it, and for getting this good of intelligence, the chiefe Officers would be liberall to thoſe whom they put in truſt, ſeeing without it little good ſervice can be effected, and the getting of it is the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of many Cavaliers and their credits.</p>
               <p>Therefore whether he be defender or purſuer, intelligence gives him a kinde of aſſurance in all his actions, and the loſſe, or neglect of it hath rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed many a brave Commander of their fame and credit, being ſurprized through over ſight, as <hi>Gustavus Horne</hi> was at <hi>Bambricke:</hi> It was alſo the loſſe of <hi>Hano,</hi> and <hi>Philipsburg;</hi> Intelligence then being of ſuch moment, it

               <p>HAving intelligence of our enemies ſtrength, how he lies, whether in Quarter, Garriſon, Field, or Leaguer, then having an exployt to goe on, we muſt recognoſce on horſe or foote, according to the exployt we have before us. As if we were to blocke up a Towne with a part of an Armie, we muſt firſt being accompanied with a few Horſemen recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſce the bounds, riding the Circuit ſhort or long from it, fore-ſeeing how to divide our number on the Paſſes &amp; Avenues from or towards the Towne, to ſtop out-fallings, or in commings, in ordering ſuch Workes and Skonces to be made on the paſſages, as may put us in ſafetie, as well againſt out-fallings, as againſt their pretended Reliefes to come: and our watches one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, muſt keepe due correſpondence by their Centries, that none can paſſe betwixt them without advertiſing one anothers guard.</p>
               <p>Next being to beleaguer a Towne neere hand, we ought to recognoſce al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo neerer, having firſt placed our Armie foote and horſe Battell without reach of their Cannon, though in their view: having firſt directed our parties of horſe to batter the ſtreets without us, then the Commander is to ride the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit of the Towne within ſhot, as neere as he can, having another riding at a diſtance behinde him, and having a Boore beſide him, reſolving him of all Queſtions concerning their Ports, their Graffes, their Bulworkes, where weakeſt, and where the Graffe is ſhalloweſt; which being knowne, he diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Armie on ſeverall Poſts, where againe the Commanders are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognoſce neerer the walls, where they can beſt lodge their greateſt bodie in moſt ſafetie, where to place their Guard before them, and where their Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; as alſo where to place their Batteries, and where to beginne their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches: which being done, they are thought the beſt fellowes, that ſhew moſt diligence, and leaſt loſſe to come to the walles; the ſame circumſtances are to be obſerved by any Commander, who leads a partie before a Strength or Caſtle to blocke it, or beleaguer it, having Cannon, Pittards, and fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workes, with ſufficient men and furniture belonging to the Artillerie, that can diſcharge their duties, as they are directed by the Commander of the partie, who muſt ſee to all things himſelfe, that it be well done, as in ſpeciall to the placing of his Batteries, and in ordering all things to be brought to the Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that are needfull, by the Souldiers commanded out to attend the workes, beſide the guard of the Cannon, and of the workemen, he muſt alſo be very vigilant in viſiting the Approaches, Batteries, and Guards, admoniſhing them to be carefull againſt out-falls on the Trenches, Batteries, or Guards, giving orders to the Captaine of the Watches to receive the enemie falling out with a ſtrong bodie of Pikes and Muskets cloſſe together to beate them backe, being received with Pikes charged, bravely flancked and lined with ſhot,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:132555:167"/>which being done, to advance their workes againe night and day, till the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my be forced to Accord.</p>
               <p>In the night alſo a ſufficient Sergeant being ſeconded by another ſtout fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, ſhould creepe to the Graffe, with two halfe-Pikes, for to wade through, to know the ſhalloweſt parts, being helpt thereto by ſome knowne Boore, who might give certaintie of the enemies ſtrength within, and of their defects they have of victualls, Amunition, fire or water. As alſo to know their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſorting-Ports, to watch their out-commings; he ought alſo to learne what draw-bridges are within, and what Portcullis, and what ſtore of victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls, or Amunition is to be had within, in caſe the Strength be pregnable, that he may the better make his Accord. Alſo he ought to learne what Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery or Armes are within, and what Caducks, or what number of Horſes pertaining to the enemie, and what other riches they have, and where kept; or if otherwiſe the Towne be not taken by Accord, or ſtrength of hand, we muſt ſtrive to force it to yeeld by hunger, or by lacke of fire or water, or otherwiſe by throwing Artificiall fire amongſt them with Cannon, or with other fiery Engins, fiering their houſes, or ſpoyling their Watches on their Poſts or Guards; as alſo we muſt deale by fraud to convey private Letters unto them, for deboyſing the Inhabitants, to reſiſt the Garriſon in making ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Port or Poſt good, while as the purſuer intends to fall on, on ſtorme or breach.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe the purſuer had neede to diſpoſe well of his owne watches with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, that he be not ſurprized, his hooffe-watch, particular watches, reſerves, or by-watches, are to be ſtill in readineſſe to attend the enemies out-falling, leſt he may cut off his Guards, or ſpoyle his Cannon by nayling of them, or by bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their Carriages, or Amunition, being diſgracefull in the higheſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as oft-times hath hapned to unprovident and ſluggiſh Commanders, who have unwiſely deſpiſed their enemies.</p>
               <p>An enemy being in the Field, either with a ſtrong partie or Armie, a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Commander muſt be carefull in recognoſcing the Field about him, for taking his advantage of the ground, in advancing to an enemie, as alſo in ſpying his advantage in caſe he be put to a Retreat, that he may the better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire in order, not being put to rout, as our Armie was at <hi>Nerling,</hi> which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hapned unto them before during the time I ſerved the <hi>Sweden.</hi> As alſo being in the Field he ought to obſerve where moſt conveniently he can plant his Ordnance, as Generall <hi>Tillie</hi> did at <hi>Leipſigh,</hi> and as the <hi>Emperialists</hi> did on the Hill at <hi>Nurenberg;</hi> as alſo at <hi>Nerling.</hi> For Ordnance being planted with advantage is oft-times the winning of the Field, and the loſſe of Artillery is ever reputed and holden for a defeate, although both foote and horſe be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. There is alſo advantage of ground very requiſit to be taken by foote againſt foote, as the advantage of hights, paſſages, woods, hedges, ditches, as alſo the advantage of Sunne and Winde with you, and againſt your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie; which his Majeſtie of worthy memory did ſtrive to get at <hi>Leipſigh</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Emperialiſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Likewiſe it is a great advantage of ground, when one of both the Armies is brought to that inconvenience, that they cannot come to fight, but the one Armie may be forced to come up but by Diviſions, while as the other by advantage of the ground may receive them with full Battailes of horſe and foote, the one to ſecond the other; and this advantage <hi>Guſtavus Horne</hi> did get of the <hi>Emperialiſts,</hi> while as he retired before them unto <hi>Vertenberg-land</hi>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:132555:168"/>in <hi>March</hi> 1633. the enemy not being able to purſue our Armie but with great diſadvantage, which freed us of them for that time, he being ſtronger than we, and afterward the <hi>Rhinegraves</hi> Forces come from <hi>Alſas</hi> being joyned with us, we made the <hi>Emperialiſts</hi> againe retire over the <hi>Danube</hi> unto <hi>Schwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> at the paſſe of <hi>Munderken,</hi> where we came within Cannon-ſhot; yet they getting the paſſe, retired in ſafetie; as they did another time from us, out of <hi>Schwabland</hi> unto <hi>Bierland,</hi> having got the paſſe before us at <hi>Kempten,</hi> and afterward over the <hi>Eler</hi> in <hi>Schwabland,</hi> having (I ſay) got the paſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, they were ſafe, and we fruſtrate. So that the advantage of ground is of great importance in warres, as I have often knowne by experience, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally before the Hill at <hi>Nurenberg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Likewiſe a wiſe Commander being defender muſt obſerve all Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, as he did in purſuing for his owne ſafetie; he muſt alſo being defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der beſet well all paſſes, and frontier Garriſons, whereupon the enemie muſt paſſe to come unto him, having timely recognoſced the ſame, that it may either be beſet by him, or otherwiſe being found more advantagious for the enemie, it would then be timely demoliſhed.</p>
               <p>As alſo your enemies Armie, or ſtrong partie being drawne up in the field, you are to recognoſce both his ſtrength and order, by the ſight of your eye, before you intend to purſue him, where you are to conſider, how he can advance to you, or you to him without diſorder, but doe you never purſue, except with advantage; though you ſhall be deemed by others to be remiſſe, but rather ſuffer him to be gone, than to take the diſadvantage of purſute, ſince time will alter any thing, and he that preſerves an Armie will doubtleſſe finde a convenient time to fight. And it had beene good for the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> in <hi>Dutchland,</hi> that this point had beene more wiſely lookt unto at <hi>Nerling</hi> than it was, for they might have ſaved their Armie and Countrey both, had they not preſumed with diſadvantage in their owne ſtrength and courage, where GOD the diſpoſer of hearts made their pride ſuffer a great fall.</p>

               <p>A Commander ought not be ignorant of the circumſtances belonging to the quartering of an Army, therefore for the better Information of the younger ſort, who have not ſeene ſuch Marches as I have bin at, with his Majeſty of worthy memory, who quartered his Army Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer or Winter, according as the occaſion or neereneſſe of his enemy did offer, where many times the whole winters night, the Army, horſe, foote and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, being without fire, did ſtand in battaile order by their Armes in the fields, having placed their Artillery apart, with a guard to attend them, their baggage alſo being behinde them apart, and well guarded, and a maine guard being commanded out apart before the Army, of horſe and foote; And the Armies being neere one another, all Officers were commanded to abide on their ſeverall charges, as they were commanded on the March, to leade Briggads, Troopes or Diviſions; The commanded men being alſo apart next unto the enemy, with their Officers by them, which all being orderly quartered in this firſt manner, they entertained one another with ſuch dainties as the time afforded, paſſing the night with variety of merry jeſts and diſcourſes till day, that either Drumme or Trumpet did invite them unto earneſt.</p>
               <p>The ſecond forme of our quartering was in the fields not being neere an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, where we quartered a little more commodiouſly for our eaſe, being commonly drawne up by foure or five of the clocke in the afternoone, neere ſome Towne or Village, in ſome faire meadow by water, if it could be had in the Summer, and in the Winter being quartered, we drew neere the ſide of ſome wood, both for fire, and for build or ſhelter; The Army drew up in battaile by Briggads, as they marched, where behinde the place the Brig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gads drew up unto, at a reaſonable diſtance, their quarters were marked out ſeverally according as they ſtood in battaile, and before the Briggads re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from their Armes, their guards were firſt commanded out, every Briggads guard being placed at a diſtance of foure ſcore paces from their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, where they were appointed to watch, and the watch being ſet, Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries were put to the Colours, and then the Pike-men were ordained to ſix their Pikes faſt in the ground as they ſtood in battaile, the Musketiers alſo were ordained in dry wether to ſet up their Muskets in order in even front, with their Colours, but when it rained, they were commanded to keepe them carefully dry by themſelves, which all orderly done they were ſuffered part and part to goe, and provide themſelves of ſtraw and fire, providing alſo many times well for their Officers Kitchins beſide.</p>
               <p>The Artillery and Amunition waggons being alſo drawne up a part, and well guarded, their horſes were ſent to graſſe for good quarters, then the Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage and wagons as they came up did draw up orderly behinde their owne
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:132555:171"/>Regiments, and their horſes being ſent to graſſe, the Officers Tents were ſet up orderly at a diſtance before their Colours, and then cookes went to dreſſe meate and all being returned to quarters before ſupper, the whole Drummes of the Army did beate before their ſeverall Briggads, invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all to publique prayers, which were never forgotten; And after prayers the Majors of the Regiments did give out orders for that night to the Serge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, and for up-breaking the next morning, and then all went to meate firſt, and next to reſt, and the whole horſmen were drawne up in this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, and parties were ſent out of their quarters to batter the ſtreets, two or three mile off, the whole night, leſt we ſhould be ſurpriſed by an enemy without intelligence.</p>
               <p>The next morning Drummes having called all to Armes, the Briggad, that had the Van, marched out firſt in a new ground, and drew up, the Briggad, that had the Van the day before, marched out, drawing up on their left hand having fallen backe one degree from the Van, and then the reſt of the Briggads drew out orderly, one after another, till the left hand of the foote Army were cloſed up, and then they went to prayers, and the prayers ended, they marched, the Baggage marching after, being drawne up in order, as the Briggads or Regiments did march, ſo did they. The Artillery marched with the Briggads, in part, and the reſt marched before the Army with their Convoyes, and guard of Musketiers, which were changed every two dayes, being commanded men out of all Regiments proportionally, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Officers, commanded them accordingly. Thus much of quartering in the fields.</p>
               <p>The third manner of quartering, an enemy being a farre off, and we neere Townes, onely in cold weather, quarterings were given for the <hi>Hoffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaffe</hi> (being the King or Generall and their followers) and the principall Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Army, including his Majeſties houſhold, whoſe quarters were firſt appointed by the generall quarter-maſter in the Townes, and next to the <hi>Hoffe-ſtaffe</hi> the Colonells, that commanded Briggads, were quartered, and next to them, the Colonells of Regiments, their Officers and Souldiers: agreat part, and the beſt of the quarters ordained for the Officers belonging to the Artillery, their horſes and ſervants. The Artillery and baggage ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without the Towne, thoſe who quartered within the Towne, had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of free meate and drinke, and no more; ſometimes without Townes we had quarters given to Briggads apart in Dorps, Randez-vouz being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for us, the next morning to draw upon for to joyne with the Army, and while as we quartered in Dorps being drawne up without the Dorpe, firſt we ſighted the paſſes, and the guards placed in the fields on the <hi>Avenues,</hi> leſt the enemy unawares might enter the quarters, the Centries duely ſet, our Colours were conveyed with a Troope to their lodging or quarter, their furriers ſhuts leading them aright till the Colours were quartered and guarded, then the reſt ſhowne unto their quarter, men were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to goe meete the Baggage to leade them to their quarters. Orders given, every man entertained another, as they had beſt reaſon, and all being ſetled, parties of horſe were ſent forth to ſcoure the fields for intelligence, and leſt they might be trapped by the enemy, a ſecond party was ſent out after them, both getting orders, how farre to ride, and upon what ſtreets, being commanded where to hault, and forrage, as alſo being admoniſhed to have ſtill a party on horsbacke to advertiſe the reſt from being ſurprized, which
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:132555:171"/>done, Ordnance-Rutters of every Briggad were left to waite on the Generall, at his Quarter, for Orders; the generall Randez-vouz for the Horſe being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, where to meete when ever they got Orders.</p>
               <p>The fourth manner of quartering an Armie is in a faſt Leaguer, as at <hi>Statin, Swede, Brandenburg, Verben, Donavert, Ausburg, Engolstat, Nurenberg,</hi> which manner of quartering is moſt troubleſome both for Officers and Souldiers, who having builded Receptacles for themſelves, their charges and travels beſtowed in vaine, many times they leave their houſes to their enemies, yet the forme is commendable, being under an Armie that is well payd, where all things may be had for money, and then the Leaguer being kept cleane, and in good order, it repreſents a Common-weale or a Citie defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible againſt all incumbrances which may occurre; except it pleaſe the <hi>Lord</hi> to wagge his hand, and then no counſell or ſtrength can availe againſt Him who is the God of Hoſtes. The uſe Cavaliers, or Commanders have to make of this ſort of quartering is, that in caſe they happen to have Command themſelves, they may learne through this practiſe to command others, as alſo through fore-ſight they may timely take themſelves to this kinde of defenſive warre, till they be able to come into the Fields, as his Majeſty of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy memory did, being forced to retire by the power of his enemies to the former Leaguers, wherein there was diſcipline and good practice to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by Cavaliers, where the Kings Majeſtie was made to dwell as the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Souldier, being alike ſubject to the inconvenience as others, which might happen, of ayre, ſickneſſe, infection, or of watching. Thus farre then for the quartering of an Armie.</p>

               <head>Of Artillerie an Obſervation.</head>
               <p>ARtillery being the third part of an Armie, without which no Armie can be gloriouſly led; it is requiſit then ſomewhat briefly to ſpeake of the advantages we have by Artillerie, being well foreſeene and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, as it was by the Captaine of Kings and King of Captaines, <hi>Guſtavus</hi> the Invincible, who with as little Charge did as much as any King or Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine could (in doing of ſo great exploits as he did) with his Artillery. But leſt I ſhould be thought to neglect a part of my dutie in this point concerning Cannon, I will ſet downe here when his Majeſtie made moſt uſe of Cannon, to my knowledge; which being rightly conſidered, will be thought ſtrange, ſeeing in the whole courſe of his Majeſties warres during his time, I never ſaw or did learne he ſhot a breach in any place, except at <hi>Garts,</hi> though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe I knew well his Majeſtie made good uſe of his Artillerie, as at <hi>Leip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigh,</hi> the <hi>Leacke,</hi> and at <hi>Leitzen,</hi> where in all three he ſhewed himſelfe Maſter of that Art. But againſt either Towne, or Fort, I did never ſee in his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties time one breach ſhot or entred, his fortune being ſuch, and his diligence ſo great, that his enemies did ever Parlé before they would abide the furie of his Cannon; as at <hi>Brandenburg, Damaine, Fransfurt, Mentz, Donavert, Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> and divers more; and in my opinion, the terrour the Cannon breeds
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:132555:172"/>is as much to be feared as the execution that followes, though it be great; and Artillery in all Armies and things belonging thereto, are of infinit moment on all occaſions. So that they may be called <hi>Sine quo nihil;</hi> but ſupreame Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Field, are no more troubled with them, but ſo farre as they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect others to doe the ſervice, their owne Officers being appointed to attend them, as the Generall to the Artillerie, his Colonells, Lievetenant-Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nells, Majors, Captaines, Lievetenants, Conſtables, and all other inferiour Officers needfull to attend, who know and keepe their owne Turnes and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefes, as other Officers doe theirs; their furniture is great and their charges alſo in buying Horſes to draw their Cannon and Amunition, Waggons, with Powder, Ball, Match, Materials, Fire-Engins, Petards, ſtorming Ladders, Artificiall Bridges carried on Waggons to paſſe over Rivers or Graffes.</p>
               <p>In all quartering they are quartered next after the Hoffeſtaffe before any Briggad, and the furniture and charges needfull to maintaine this third part of the Armie is extraordinary great, there being alwayes ſomething to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, while as the Armie doth reſt; and oft-times they muſt be provided of a great deale of new furniture, and they loſe yearely an extraordinary number of Horſes of great price. But his Majeſtie during his time was very fortunate in this, as in other things; for I never knew his Majeſtie loſe any Ordnance, but I have ſeene him get ſupply of Amunition and Cannon from his enemies; as firſt, at <hi>Garts</hi> and <hi>Grefenhaugne, Damaine, Francford, Lansburg, Glogo, Leip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigh, Vertsburg, Mentz,</hi> and <hi>Munchen,</hi> beſides the ſupply his Majeſtie did get for his Artillerie from <hi>Nurenberg, Francfurt, Ausburg, Strasburg</hi> and <hi>Vlme:</hi> and to diſcourſe largely of this ſubject alone, would take a volume of paper. But when every Cavalier is commanded apart with a partie where he muſt make uſe of Cannon, he would be (before his departure with his partie) very carefull to receive his Cannon with the furniture belonging unto it timely toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with ſufficient Officers for diſcharging that part of the dutie, on his march he muſt command his partie as if it were a little Armie, being ever well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided of Guides, and of carefull, wittie, and painefull Intelligencers, that he may leade and quarter his partie with aſſurance, directing alwayes his Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencer before him, being ever carefull to beſet the paſſes and avenues well. As alſo ſufficiently to guard his Cannon, Baggage, and Amunition, ſince ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times great hurt doth come thorow the neglect of guarding the Cannon and Amunition: which over-ſights once committed are irrecoverable; in regard whereof I muſt entreate the gentle Reader to pardon me a little here out of Hiſtorie (for the younger Souldier his better inſtruction) to diſcourſe a little of the hurt and inconvenience hath happened many times by Cannon and powder; as alſo of the manner they were firſt invented, being found out by <hi>Gods</hi> permiſſion for the ruine of man puniſhed for finne; experience doth teach daily that the ſtrength of it is not to be reſiſted.</p>

               <p>Now of late the invention is found out of burning Bullets, full of fire, ſhot out of Cannon, to fire houſes within Strengths, and to fire Palleſads and Gabeons ſet before Batreries on walles or in Fields, whereof his Majeſtie of <hi>Polle Estien Bathon</hi> made good uſe in his warres of <hi>Muſco,</hi> within a few yeares.</p>
